AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate longitudinal multimodal imaging findings in a case of neovascular age-related macular degeneration presenting with multiple retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears showing progressive RPE restoration. METHODS: Observational clinical case report. RESULTS: A 79-year-old woman diagnosed with neovascular age-related macular degeneration developed 3 consecutive RPE tears in her right eye during the course of treatment with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. The RPE tears initially appeared hypoautofluorescent on fundus autofluorescence. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography showed contractile folds of the RPE with adjacent subretinal fluid and overlying ellipsoid zone disruption. Over an 8-year follow-up period, the RPE defects progressively resolved with a return of patchy fundus autofluorescence. Eye-tracked spectral domain optical coherence tomography showed gradual restoration of the RPE band defects over an enlarging Type 1 neovascular lesion. CONCLUSION: Some RPE tears may show observable remodeling and restoration over time. These changes may be followed longitudinally with multimodal imaging, including eye-tracked spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence.

AB  - Reforestation of degraded forests with small to medium-scale monoculture plantation following mechanized ground-based harvesting has been widely applied in the past decades in Hyrcanian forests, but no studies have clearly characterized the restoration of soil properties following tree plantation in the temperate forests. We aimed to assess the efficacy of different plantation types (treatments) including Caucasian alder (Alnus subcordata; AS), Velvet maple (Acer velutinum; AV), and Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens var. horizontalis; CS) on the recovery of litter and soil properties over a 25-year period in the Tangar district in the Tyrumrud region of the Hyrcanian forests (Iran), compared to levels at the natural hornbeam-oak stand as a control. In each treatment (plantations with average length of 250 m and width of 200 m), three sample plots were measured and provided 81 soil samples. Tree species had significant differences on litter thickness and quality with the lowest litter thickness (4.2 cm), carbon (C) content (32.75%), and C/N ratio (15.56) and highest nitrogen (N) content (2.11%) in the Alnus subcordata (AS) plantation. Significantly higher recovery values of soil physical properties including soil bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, penetration resistance, and aggregate stability were found in the AS plantation. However, soil physical properties did not fully recover in AS, Acer velutinum (AV), and Cupressus sempervirens (CS) plantation even after a 25-year period, compared to the control area. The significantly higher recovery of pH, EC, N, N storage, available nutrient, earthworm density, biomass, soil microbial respiration, and the lowest C, C/N ratio, C storage were observed in the AS plantation. The fine root biomass among the three plantation types did not fully recover compared to natural stands. Our study revealed that the roots of the planted trees initiated soil structure recovery, whereas the N-fixing tree species such AS significantly ameliorated the tested soil properties over a 25-year period following compaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We consider a class of nonstandard high-order PDEs models, based on the p(⋅)-Laplace operator with variable exponents, for image denoising and image inpainting problems. These models are obtained from the minimization of a family of anisotropic energies that range between the so called TV−H−1 and the biharmonic models. The PDEs system consists of quasi-linear equations that we solve with a fixed point iterative method and we prove the convergence of the iterative process. To solve the problems, we consider an algorithm which includes a practical and efficient adaptive strategy for the choice of the exponent 1&lt;p≤2, which allows us to fit to the multi-scale nature of the images. We present several numerical examples to test our approach and to make some comparisons with existing methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Extreme events such as disasters cause partial or total disruption of basic services such as water, energy, communication and transportation. In particular, roads can be damaged or blocked by debris, thereby obstructing access to certain affected areas. Thus, restoration of the damaged roads is necessary to evacuate victims and distribute emergency commodities to relief centers or affected areas. The Crew Scheduling and Routing Problem (CSRP) addresses decisions in post-disaster situations with the aim of minimizing the time that affected areas remain inaccessible. The integration of crew scheduling and routing decisions makes this problem too complicated to be effectively solved for practical instances using mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations recently proposed in the literature. Therefore, we propose a branch-and-Benders-cut (BBC) algorithm that decomposes the integrated problem into a master problem (MP) with scheduling decisions and subproblems with routing decisions. Computational tests based on instances from the literature show that the proposed exact method improves the results of MIP formulations and other exact and metaheuristic methods proposed in literature. The BBC algorithm provides feasible solutions and optimality gaps for instances that thus far have not been possible to solve by exact methods in the literature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The planning of post-disruption restoration in critical infrastructure systems often relies on deterministic assumptions such as complete information on resources and known duration of the repair tasks. In fact, the uncertainties faced by restoration activities, e.g. stemming from subjective estimates of resources and costs, are rarely considered. Thus, the solutions obtained by a deterministic approach may be suboptimal or even infeasible under specific realizations of the uncertainties. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the effects of uncertain repair time and resources on the post-disruption restoration of critical infrastructure. Two-stage stochastic optimization provides insights for prioritizing the intensity and time allocation of the repair activities with the objective of maximizing system resilience. The inherent stochasticity is represented via a set of scenarios capturing specific realizations of repair activity durations and available resources, and their probabilities. A multi-mode restoration model is proposed that offers more flexibility than its single-mode counterpart. The restoration framework is applied to the reduced British electric power system and the results demonstrate the added value of using the stochastic model as opposed to the deterministic model. Particularly, the benefits of the proposed stochastic method increase as the uncertainty associated with the restoration process grows. Finally, decision-making under uncertainty largely impacts the optimum repair modes and schedule. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Critical infrastructure networks such as electric power, water distribution, natural gas, transportation and telecommunications are the backbone of modern societies as they provide them with the services that are essential for their continuous functioning. However, these infrastructure networks are not isolated from each other but instead, most of them rely on one another to be functional. Hence, they are highly vulnerable to any disruptive event (e.g., components deteriorating, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters) which makes their restoration more challenging task for decision makers. In this paper, we study the restoration problem of a system of interdependent infrastructure networks following a disruption event considering different disruptions scenarios. We propose a resilience-driven multi-objective restoration model using mixed-integer programming that aims to maximize the resilience of the system of interdependent infrastructure networks while minimizing the total cost associated with the restoration process. The restoration model considers the availability of limited time and resources and provides a prioritized list of components, nodes or links, to be restored along with assigning and scheduling them to the available work crews. The proposed model is illustrated through a generated system of interdependent power-water networks, however it is applicable to any physically interdependent networks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to deal with the uncertainty of renewable distributed generators (DGs) and load under fault conditions in distribution network, a service restoration method based on stochastic response surface method (SRSM) is proposed. After the input variables are processed by correlation, chaotic second-order polynomials are introduced, and the probability distributions of each state variable are obtained by solving its coefficients. Moreover, network reconfiguration is combined with intending islanding to resolve the service restoration problem in the distribution network. For a network structure that does not satisfy the probability constraint, the load is cut until it is satisfied. In the iterative process of service restoration algorithm, the stochastic response surface method is adopted to deal with the uncertainty, which can maximize power supply recovery of outage areas under the premise of satisfying the probability constraint. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 33-bus system and TPC 84-bus system for testing. The comparison with other algorithms validates the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The variational image decomposition model decomposes an image into a structural and an oscillatory component by regularization technique and functional minimization. It is an important task in various image processing methods, such as image restoration, image segmentation, and object recognition. In this paper, we propose a non-convex and non-smooth variational decomposition model for image restoration that uses non-convex and non-smooth total variation (TV) to measure the structure component and the negative Sobolev space H−1 to model the oscillatory component. The new model combines the advantages of non-convex regularization and weaker-norm texture modeling, and it can well remove the noises while preserving the valuable edges and contours of the image. The iteratively reweighted l1 (IRL1) algorithm is employed to solve the proposed non-convex minimization problem. For each subproblem, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve it. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model for both synthetic and real images in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean structural similarity index (MSSIM). © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A wide scale deployment of energy storage systems in power networks for energy balancing applications will lead to network reliability improvements. After a fault occurs in a network, energy storage will be able to help restore supply in the network areas isolated from the primary substation or in those re-connected to adjacent feeders of limited transfer capacity by emergency-ties. The reliability improvements introduced by energy storage need to be evaluated and quantified for both restoration modes. The objective of this paper is to assess the energy storage contribution in these restoration modes and to seek analytical, less computationally intensive solutions for such evaluation. The proposed analytical technique uses a probabilistic model of energy storage to assess the charge and discharge processes over a fault duration and the related operational strategy. In this way, reliability indices are calculated by taking into account the energy storage actions during a fault as well as the time-evolution of renewable generation and demand. These features lead to more realistic modelling of energy storage in analytical techniques. The proposed analytical technique was firstly validated by using a case study where the results obtained by Monte Carlo Simulation were used as a reference. Then, the proposed technique was applied to a distribution network to assess the reliability improvement provided by energy storage and to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Active thrust magnetic bearings provide an axial force to balance the moving parts of machines. However, most devices produce null or unbalancing passive forces. Furthermore, reported designs usually feature very small axial and radial gaps. This paper presents a thrust actuator for wide axial gaps that produces both passive and active restoring axial forces. It features a long biconical rotor and a stator housing a single winding and two permanent magnets. Simulations are done using finite-element-analysis (FEA) and compared to magnetic circuit analysis and experimental results from a prototype with a diameter of 48 mm and 20 mm axial displacement. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Grain to Green (GTG) program launched in 1999 by the Chinese government is one of the largest ecological restoration programs ever implemented in the world. Although the GTG program has been demonstrated to affect ecosystem services in the revegetated areas, its impacts on regional climate are seldom reported and poorly understood. Therefore, our study examined the impacts of revegetation owing to the GTG program on summer climate in the Loess Plateau, by incorporating near real-time remotely sensed land use/land cover data and vegetation characteristics of 2001 and 2010 into a coupled land-atmosphere model. From 2001 to 2010, a considerable portion of croplands was converted to forests and grasslands, with vegetation fraction and LAI increasing while surface albedo decreasing throughout the Loess Plateau. Compared with those from 2001, simulation results from 2010 indicated lowered 2-m air temperature in summer, with the magnitude of reduction in nighttime minimum (as high as 0.8–1.0 ℃) greater than that in daytime maximum (generally restricted to 0.4 ℃). The concurrent decrease in summertime 2-m specific humidity further led to widespread reduction of near-surface heat content (i.e., moist enthalpy). Summer precipitation decreased in northern Shanxi province and western Loess Plateau (up to 1.0–1.4 mm/day) while increasing in southeastern Loess Plateau (between 1.0–2.0 mm/day). Our findings underscore that vegetation restoration has exerted strong influences on regional climate, and provide useful information for the sustainable implementation of the GTG program. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the twentieth century the heavily channelized Raba River incised deeply in its mountain course. Abandonment of channelization structures in a 2.3-km-long reach within a forested corridor was followed by considerable channel widening during floods of 30- and 35-year recurrence interval, re-establishment of a multi-thread channel pattern and island development. Morphological and botanical surveys were conducted annually between 2011 and 2017 to determine the processes and patterns governing development of islands and their floristic complexity. Hydraulic conditions promoting establishment and persistence of islands were determined with one-dimensional hydraulic modelling of flood flows for 8 unmanaged river cross-sections with islands and 8 cross-sections in the adjacent channelized reaches. Average age, number of islands and their average and total area in the reach markedly increased over the study period. However, the increase was not steady but moderated by island erosion by flood flows, island establishment shortly after major floods and island coalescence in the years without such floods. Hydraulic modelling indicated that river cross-sections with islands are typified by significantly lower values of mean water depth, flow velocity, unit stream power and bed shear stress at flood flows than cross-sections in the adjacent, channelized reaches. Such conditions promote deposition of living driftwood on channel bars, initiating island development, and reduce the probability of erosion of existing islands. The total number of plant species on islands varied highly and either exceeded or was similar to that recorded on riparian forest plots in particular years. This study indicates that (i) island re-establishment in the river was initiated by substantial channel widening, (ii) variation in flood magnitudes exerts a considerable influence on the trajectory of island development, and (iii) the contribution of islands to the overall species richness of plant communities in the river corridor at early stages of island re-establishment may be highly varied. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many lakes worldwide, especially shallow, experience great changes due to eutrophication, manifested in severe, usually toxic water blooms, disqualifying them from recreation. In order to improve water quality, restoration programs are implemented, including numerous methods. Intense nutrient cycling resulting from detrimental role of sediments impede obtaining of clear water state. One of the restoration methods proposed in recent years was Effective Microorganisms (EM), i.e. the set of microorganisms aiming at the inhibition of harmful bacteria through competitive exclusion. This approach was introduced in shallow Konin Lake (Western Poland), suffering from severe cyanobacterial water blooms. Prior to the treatment, protective action was conducted i.e. the elimination of external nutrient loads with backwater from the river. Changes in water chemistry, phytoplankton structure and macrophytes distribution were noted during the 5-year studies (2011–2015), covering the treatment (2013–2015) as well as two previous years. Oscillatoriacean cyanobacteria were most abundant in (2011−2012), while Nostocales in summer 2014–2015, as a result of decreased phosphorus but increased nitrogen concentrations. Slight increase in Cladoceran zooplankton was observed, but none in submerged macrophytes due to low water transparency. EM application initiated positive changes in the ecosystem by means of excessive organic matter decomposition and increased diversity of phytoplankton, nevertheless cyanobacteria blooms were still present due to high nutrient content. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecosystem service (ES) bundles can facilitate comprehensive understanding of the spatial configurations and interactions of multiple ESs across large-scale landscapes. They are critical for informing policy and improving ecosystem management. The spatial dimension of ES bundles has been addressed in recent research but little work has considered the temporal changes of ES bundles. This paper uses a case study in the Loess Plateau, the core area of vegetation restoration in China, to explore changes in ES spatial distributions, bundle types and multiple ES interactions in a period of rapid vegetation restoration between 2000 and 2015. Measurable proxies, biophysical indicators and the InVEST model were used to quantify 10 ESs. We found that (1) most of the ESs were improved, especially provisioning services and carbon sequestration. (2) There is a steady tradeoff between provisioning services and most regulating services, while the impacts of vegetation restoration on agricultural production were small. (3) The synergies among ESs were weakened, implying the presence of subtle functional ES interdependencies. (4) Changes in the bundling patterns between 2000 and 2015 revealed heightened gaps among ESs due to the upsurge of carbon sequestration and deterioration of the baseflow regulation. This research provides a new perspective for understanding the interactions between multiple ESs with regional vegetation restoration activities. Ecological restoration programmes play an important role in enhancing ESs, but they may also lead to expanded gaps between ESs. Baseflow regulation could be included as a key indicator to support a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of restoration interventions. The ES bundle framework is able to capture changes over time of the ES interactions across a large-scale landscape and facilitates informed ES management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dissolved carbon (DC) is a critical component of the global carbon (C) cycle. DC transport occurs through water-driven erosion and infiltration during rain storms. To explore the specific role of DC flux in topsoil C pool dynamics during rainfall events and predict the trend of ratios of lateral versus vertical DC efflux from topsoil in a vegetation restoration area, we measured the major DC fluxes at four runoff plots, during rainfall events in an eroding soil landscape on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results show that topsoil vertical DC efflux into deep soil layers accounted for approximately 98.7 (±1.0) % of the total dissolved carbon efflux in plots with vegetation versus 95.3% in a plot without vegetation. The carbon sequestration capacity of the top soil would be underestimated by up to 38 (±5) % if the vertical DC efflux was omitted. The ratios of lateral versus vertical DC efflux tended to increase with rainfall intensity. The results of this study improve understanding of the carbon cycle processes during rainfall events in general and estimation of carbon sequestration rates in vegetation restoration regions such as the Chinese Loess Plateau in particular. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Approximately 1.5 M residents of the Phoenix metropolitan area rely upon the Salt Verde River watershed in central Arizona, USA, to meet their water demands. However, the health of the semi-arid watershed is at risk. Densely populated forests increase the probability of catastrophic wildfire and threaten the watershed's integrity. Restoration reduces the risk of catastrophic wildfire and improves the health and productivity of the watershed. While current research indicates public support of watershed restoration, little guidance exists for land managers regarding the relative benefits of restoration projects. We estimate benefits of watershed restoration projects in the Salt-Verde River watershed using a choice experiment. The survey focuses on residents of the Phoenix metropolitan area as beneficiaries of watershed restoration and includes public access, surface water quality, groundwater recharge, critical habitat, and cultural significance as attributes. Willingness to pay estimates are obtained using a Bayesian mixed logit model. Respondents have a positive and statistically significant willingness to pay for all attributes. The highest willingness to pay is a one-time fee of $41.92 for restoration projects that protect critical habitats for endangered and threatened species. Our results also provide one of the first estimates for groundwater recharge as an attribute of watershed restoration. The benefit estimates obtained can directly inform land managers regarding restoration in semi-arid landscapes and assist in clearly delineating difficult to quantify environmental benefits in cost-benefit analyses of proposed future projects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With increasing awareness of the importance of wetlands, the number of new or restored wetlands in China is steadily growing; however, not all of them fulfill their expected ecological function. Maintaining wetlands in their optimal state is an urgent problem that requires research into the ecosystem evaluation, regulation, and biomass management of wetlands. The Ecopath with Ecosim (EWE) model, also known as the ecological channel model, is a balance model that can directly construct the ecological system structure and describe its energy flow and mass transfer through the principle of nutrition dynamics. Here, the EWE model is applied to determine the ecosystem status of a newly restored wetland, Zhushanhu wetland, in the Lake Tai buffer zone of Zhushan Bay, and evaluate the current ecological regulations and biomass control measures. Our results provide theoretical and scientific support for the management and maintenance of wetland ecological restorations. © 2018

AB  - EU's Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 sets a 15% restoration target. However, the understanding of restoration as a management tool remains ambiguous at EU and Member State levels. As a country with rich biodiversity but low GDP, a well-defined priority setting approach is key for Bulgaria. The “Methodological framework for assessment and mapping of ecosystem condition and ecosystem services in Bulgaria” proposes a transition towards ecosystem management and monitoring of the Socio-Ecological System (SES), to be embedded in the environmental policy framework. We extend the analogy between SES and the human body's system in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a way to inform restoration priority setting and development of restoration and monitoring tools at several levels: 1. Overall objective: the sustainability goals correspond to the TCM's objective of a healthy, balanced body2. Restoration objectives and functioning: the desired ecosystem state can be better understood in analogy between the ecosystem structure and functioning framework for multiparametric optimization, and the TCM framework of Ying-Yang, Eight principles, Five elements and organs3. Ecosystem monitoring: Integrated monitoring may benefit from comparison to TCM diagnostics4. Ecosystem management approaches can benefit from the analogy to the TCM system of meridiansWe apply the analogy and find that spatially explicit decision making on restoration, streamlined ecosystem monitoring and a number of other issues (green infrastructure, designation of protected areas, defragmentation and connectivity, cumulative impact assessment, etc.), are easier to understand, communicate, account for and manage. Ecosystem restoration is priority for China and the country has accumulated research and practical experience, including study of links between ecosystem management and the historical principles of Chinese philosophy. The Bulgarian and European approach to ecosystem based management can benefit from analogies to TCM. We derive policy recommendations by analogy, and illustrate them on the example of Natural Capital Accounting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Open-pit mine is still an unavoidable activity but can become unsustainable without the restoration of degraded sites. Monitoring the restoration after extractive activities is a legal requirement for mine companies and public administrations in many countries, involving financial provisions for environmental liabilities. The objective of this contribution is to present a rigorous, low-cost and easy-to-use application of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) for supporting opencast mining and restoration monitoring, complementing the inspections with very high (<10 cm) spatial resolution multispectral imagery, and improving any restoration documentation with detailed land cover maps. The potential of UAS as a tool to control restoration works is presented in a calcareous quarry that has undergone different post-mining restoration actions in the last 20 years, representing 4 reclaimed stages. We used a small (<2 kg) drone equipped with a multispectral sensor, along with field spectroradiometer measurements that were used to radiometrically correct the UAS sensor data. Imagery was processed with photogrammetric and Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems software, resulting in spectral information, vegetation and soil indices, structural information and land cover maps. Spectral data and land cover classification, which were validated through ground-truth plots, aided in the detection and quantification of mine waste dumping, bare soil and other land cover extension. Moreover, plant formations and vegetation development were evaluated, allowing a quantitative, but at the same time visual and intuitive comparison with the surrounding reference systems. The protocol resulting from this research constitutes a pipeline solution intended for the implementation by public administrations and privates companies for precisely evaluating restoration dynamics in an expedient manner at a very affordable budget. Furthermore, the proposed solution prevents subjective interpretations by providing objective data, which integrate new technologies at the service of scientists, environmental managers and decision makers. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - In semiarid terrestrial ecosystems, optimized eco-rehabilitation strategies, such as land preparations and planting vegetation, are keys to achieve a successful ecological restoration. Land preparations and vegetation are supposed to have the coupled and respective impacts on soil ecosystem services, which are still unclear now. In this study, eighteen experimental plots with six different combinations and repetitions of land preparations and vegetation were built in the Chinese Loess Plateau in 2014 and soil moisture storages (SMS), soil carbon stocks (SCS) and other soil nutrient stocks were calculated at 0–100 cm, also the effects of land preparations and planting vegetation on soil eco-hydrological services are analyzed by mathematical methods. The results show that leveled ditches-M. sativa had the highest SMS (125 mm) while zig terraces-P. tabulaeformis had the lowest values (88 mm). Fish-scale pits-P. tabulaeformis had the most SCS (9804 g/m2) and leveled ditches-M. sativa had the lowest values (8163 g/m2). For soil nutrient stocks, leveled benches-C. microphylla and fish-scale pits-P. tabulaeformis had the highest levels while leveled ditches-M. sativa had the lowest values. The partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) and variation partitioning (VP) analysis indicated that soil nutrient stocks were most affected by the coupling effects of land preparation and vegetation. SMS at surface (0–10 cm) were mainly affected by precipitation (58.8%). Furthermore, SMS at subsurface (10–60 cm) and deep soil layer (60–100 cm) were affected by the shared effects of vegetation and land preparation (61.3%), and vegetation (72.2%), respectively. The findings quantified the coupling and respective contributions of vegetation restoration and land preparation to soil eco-hydrological services and demonstrate that the optimal combination of eco-rehabilitation strategies can achieve a sustainable land restoration. © 2018

AB  - Magnetic microparticles (MPs) have been recently proposed as innovative and promising dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) adsorbents. However, before using them in a whole-lake restoration project, it is essential to assess their toxicological effects (direct and indirect) on aquatic biota. In the present study we hypothesized that zooplankton community is affected by MPs used for lake restoration. To test our hypothesis we designed a microcosms experiment (n = 15) containing lake water and surface sediment from a hypertrophic lake. Temporal changes (70 days) on physico-chemical conditions and on zooplankton structure (rotifers, copepods and branchiopods) were monitored under different scenarios. In particular, three different treatments were considered: no addition of MPs (control) and MPs addition (1.4 g MPs L−1) on the surface water layer (T-W) and on the sediment (T-S). After 24 h of contact time, MPs were removed with a magnetic rake. A total of 15 zooplankton species (12 rotifers, 1 branchiopod and 2 copepods) were recorded and a high abundance of zooplankton was registered during the experiment for all treatments. No significant differences (RM-ANOVA test; p &gt; 0.05) in total abundance, species richness and species diversity among treatments were found. The absence of any effect of MPs on zooplankton can be explained because MPs did not significantly alter any of its physico-chemical (e.g. temperature, pH, O2) or biological (e.g. food quantity and quality) drivers. These results confirm the suitability of MPs as a promising tool for removing DIP in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems. © 2018

AB  - Riparian habitats are transitional zones where strong environmental gradients shape community. To prevent flood risks and channel migration on managed rivers, civil engineering techniques have been widely used. Recently, ecological restoration of rivers has become a major issue. However, given the alteration of natural disturbance regimes induced by human infrastructures, the real added-value of these restoration actions is questionable. Thus, a major challenge is to better understand whether changes in abiotic conditions induced by human activity influence the response of plant communities to environmental gradients. Studying a highly degraded large river, we evaluated the effect of the elevation and soil texture gradients on plant functional composition and assessed whether human-mediated environment gradients, achieved through maintenance and restoration measures, shape community structure. In the summer of 2017, we sampled 17 geomorphic surfaces, mostly gravel bars, along the Rhône River and its tributaries that were either repeatedly cleared (brush clearing vs plowing), newly reprofiled or naturally rejuvenated by high flows. The results show shifts in trait values with elevation and convergence in plant traits with increasing proportion of fine sediments. The co-occurrence of species with contrasting traits was higher in highly disturbed environments, revealing the importance of rejuvenation processes. However, the influence of both environmental gradients was mediated by human activity. For maintenance measures, plowing was better able to promote species diversity and limited biotic homogenization along environmental gradients. Among the three geomorphic surfaces, naturally rejuvenated bars were the most stressful environments, hosting distinct functional assemblages, while communities on newly reprofiled banks were in the same ecological trajectories as repeatedly cleared bars. To promote an effective ecological restoration of riparian zones, (i) a greater variability of the minimum flow is needed, (ii) bedload transport restoration should be a priority and (iii) reprofiled banks should better mimic the landforms of natural river margins. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With population growth and the rapid development of society and the economy, the excessive exploitation of water resources has not only aggravated the mismatch between water supply and water demand, but also caused the deterioration of ecological water environments, particularly wetland systems. Previous research efforts have analyzed the contradictions between supply and demand in the Nenjiang River Basin, but the water resource system needs further research to identify the relationship between the internal nodes and the changes of the wetland hydrological relationship. It is necessary to establish a systematic network model to evaluate the structure and functional attributes of water resources at the basin scale, and to balance water resource utilization and wetland protection. We established an ecological network representing the water resource system in the Nenjiang River Basin, studied the changes in the system-level network configurations from 2007 to 2015, and analyzed multiple scenarios. This method also reflects the impact of human activities on wetland hydrology and water resources. The results show that the structural efficiency of the water network in the Nenjiang River Basin has been declining, redundancy has increased, and the contradiction between water supply and water demand has become increasingly serious. Agricultural recession flow is the main consumer of water resources; furthermore, the wetland has high control intensity over the system. A water conservancy project changed the eco-hydrological relationship between wetlands and other hydrological units, which led to the degradation of the ecosystem and also affected the robustness of the system. Agricultural return water is an important water supplement source for wetlands, but the duration and amount of the supplement cannot reliably meet the wetlands’ ecological needs. Finally, based on the research findings, the construction of the National Wetland Park is facilitating wetland conservation. Overall, the model results provide a scientific basis for water resource and wetland ecological restoration, so as to strengthen the sustainable management of resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Significant efforts are being made to restore urban watersheds. Stormwater control measures (SCMs) reduce runoff and provide water quality treatment, and are the predominate means of achieving restoration objectives. Determining an effective implementation strategy for these measures often requires a simulation model. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is a hydrologic-hydraulic and water quality model specifically developed for use in urban watersheds. We enhanced an existing external control program for SWMM by adding automated calibration for user-selected events, sensitivity analysis capability, and a multiobjective cost-optimization feature using a well-known evolutionary solver, the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The enhanced program, RSWMM-Cost, was then applied to a previously developed SWMM model of the Difficult Run watershed of Fairfax County, Virginia. Calibration and verification were performed using the program. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying SCM attributes as a function of performance metrics. Cost-optimization was conducted on a 123.4 ha headwater subcatchment of the watershed using generalized cost relationships and constraints based upon SCM design guidance and water quality requirements. A cost-effectiveness curve was generated, consisting of sets of SCMs that either are optimal or nearly so. Thus, RSWMM-Cost can assist decision makers identify watershed management strategies that meet water quality goals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel depth restoration algorithm from RGB-D data through combining characteristics of local and non-local manifolds, which provide low-dimensional parameterizations of the local and non-local geometry of depth maps. Specifically, on the one hand, a local manifold model is defined to favor local neighboring relationship of pixels in depth, according to which, manifold regularization is introduced to promote smoothing along the manifold structure. On the other hand, the non-local characteristics of the patch-based manifold can be used to build highly data-adaptive orthogonal bases to extract elongated image patterns, accounting for self-similar structures in the manifold. We further define a manifold thresholding operator in 3D adaptive orthogonal spectral bases - eigenvectors of the discrete Laplacian of local and non-local manifolds - to retain only low graph frequencies for depth maps restoration. Finally, we propose a unified alternating direction method of multipliers optimization framework, which elegantly casts the adaptive manifold regularization and thresholding jointly to regularize the inverse problem of depth maps recovery. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art works with respect to both objective and subjective quality evaluations. © 1992-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper investigates the consequences of the organization of actors on the performances of biodiversity restoration projects. It leans on an interdisciplinary framework that uses ecological engineering information to answer an economic issue following the transaction cost economics framework. Applied to four case studies, this analysis allows us to establish a direct link between the organization of restoration projects and their ecological performance and in fine on their reproducibility. In the end we show that projects that are embedded within flexible organizational forms are in phase with ecological engineering principles and are more likely to be replicated. This focus on the organization of actors in restoration projects provides new insights to foster investment in biodiversity restoration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Restoration practitioners commonly use plantings of young seedlings to restore endangered forest communities impacted by anthropogenic disturbance, such as weed invasion and deforestation. Forest recovery may be significantly hampered by browsing pressure from herbivores, and practitioners use a variety of plant guard techniques to reduce the negative impacts of browsing on plant establishment and facilitate ecosystem regeneration. However, there is limited knowledge of which herbivore exclusion methods are most effective in protecting growing seedlings from attack and whether such benefits vary amongst different resident plant species. We compared levels of herbivore damage for 54 native rainforest tree and shrub species amongst four guard treatments that are commonly deployed by restoration practitioners to protect revegetated seedlings from attack by non-native rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) and native vertebrate herbivores during their establishment: (1) small corrugated plastic guards; (2) tall wire guards that protect single seedlings from attack; (3) small fenced exclusion plots that protect multiple revegetated seedlings as well as passively regenerating plants simultaneously; (4) unguarded plants. We also evaluated the effects of exclusion plots on the richness and composition of passively regenerating native vegetation in addition to the growth of actively revegetated seedlings through reduced herbivore activity. Herbivore activity was briefly surveyed using camera traps, and swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor) were found to be more active at the site than non-native rusa deer. All guard treatments significantly reduced browsing damage compared with unguarded plants, but corrugated plastic guards were less effective than wire guards and fenced exclusion plots. The fenced exclusion plots had the additional benefit of facilitating the passive regeneration of native plant species that may be cost prohibitive to regeneration otherwise. We also found that species varied in susceptibility to browsing, with eight species suffering high browse damage and five species low damage when unguarded. These findings highlight the potential for exclusion fences to provide more efficient and effective protection of browser preferred plants in the context of rainforest restoration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many of the world's lakes in arid endorheic basins are shrinking at alarming rates, reducing habitat and economic benefits. Lakes are commonly recovered by river regulation. However, the scarcity of water has hindered the restoration of lakes in arid regions. There is therefore an urgent demand for insight into efficient and sustainable restoration of lakes. Here a water mass balance model was used to explore the impact of flow regulation scenarios on the restoration area of East Juyan Lake (EJL), which is located in an arid zone of China. Then a fractional water loss index was introduced to examine the water storage efficiency of the lake. Results showed that the lake ecosystem has been effectively restored due to the increased streamflow entering the lake caused by the Ecological Water Diversion Project; the dynamic recovery process of lake area is related to the initial area, and streamflow input and evaporation jointly determine the lake equilibrium. Affected by lake topography, fractional water loss index responded nonlinearly to the lake area. Based on these, we determined the appropriate restoration area of 42 km2, and a discharge of 0.608 × 108 m3 of water must be maintained continuously every year to sustain this area. This paper has provided an efficient way to restore and manage lakes at their suitable size by river regulation and water transfer projects, which are important in helping policy makers make robust decisions to facilitate sustainable development in arid regions. © 2018

AB  - Drainage is a globally common disturbance in forested peatlands that impacts peat soils, forest communities, and associated ecosystem functions, calling for informed hydrologic restoration strategies. The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), located in Virginia and North Carolina, U.S.A., has been altered since colonial times, particularly by extensive ditch networks installed to lower water levels and facilitate timber harvests. Consequently, peat decomposition rates have accelerated, and red maple has become the dominant tree species, reducing the historical mosaic of bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pocosin stands. Recent repair and installation of water control structures aim to control drainage and, in doing so, enhance forest community composition and preserve peat depths. To help inform these actions, we established five transects of 15 plots each (75 plots total) along a hydrologic gradient where we measured continuous water levels and ecosystem attributes, including peat depths, microtopography, and forest composition and structure. We found significant differences among transects, with wetter sites having thicker peat, lower red maple importance, greater tree density, and higher overall stand richness. Plot-level analyses comported with these trends, clearly grouping plots by transects (via nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and resulting in significant correlations between specific hydrologic metrics and ecosystem attributes. Our findings highlight hydrologic controls on soil carbon storage, forest structure, and maple dominance, with implications for large-scale hydrologic restoration at GDS and in other degraded forested peatlands more broadly. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Annually, sand and gravel processing generates approximately 20 million tonnes of non-commercial by-product as fine silt particles (<63 μm) which constitutes approximately 20% of quarry production in the UK. This study is significant as it investigated the use of quarry silt as a sub-soil medium to partially substitute soil-forming materials whilst facilitating successful post-restoration crop establishment. In a glasshouse pot experiment, top-soil and sub-soil layering was simulated, generating an artificial sub-soil medium by mixing two quarry non-commercial by-products, i.e. silt and overburden. These were blended in three ratios (100:0, 70:30, 50:50). Pots were packed to two bulk densities (1.3 and 1.5 g cm-3) and sown with three cover crops used in the early restoration process namely winter rye (Secale cereale), white mustard (Sinapis alba) and a grassland seed mixture (Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense, Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra). Three weeks into growth, the first signs of nitrogen (N) deficiency were observed in mustard plants, with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) deficiencies observed at 35 days. Rye exhibited minor N deficiency symptoms four weeks into growth, whilst the grassland mixture showed no deficiency symptoms. The 70:30 silt:overburden sub-soil blend resulted in significantly higher Root Mass Densities of grassland seed mixture and rye in the sub-soil layer as compared with the other blends. The innovation in this work is the detailed physical, chemical and biological characterisation of silt:overburden blends and effects on root development of plants commonly used in early restoration to bio-engineer soil structural improvements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent works have demonstrated that using a properly structured prior for model-based compressive sensing (CS), can improve the recovery performance. However, there exists the low prior utilisation in previous works. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a multi-structured-wavelet Bayesian CS framework (MSW-BCS) that works for image compression with fully employing the prior knowledge. Our work can be briefly summarised by the following three aspects. Firstly, we explore the multi-structured prior knowledge, including the cluster structure and tree structure in the wavelet transform coefficients of images via statistical analyses. Secondly, a multi-variable joint recovery model is designed to describe this multi-structured prior. Finally, the detailed learning algorithm of model parameters based on variational Bayesian inference is given. The simulation experiments show that the proposed recovery model can effectively merge the different priors and achieve the superior performance compared with that of the other well-known CS algorithms under both noise-free and noisy measurement environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A wide range of different biodiversity indicators have been identified in different biomes and types of environments. However, we currently lack a clear understanding under which circumstances proposed biodiversity indicators are valid indicators and when they are not. Here we conducted a large-scale restoration experiment by emulating natural disturbances through prescribed burning and gap-cutting. From this experiment data of resident forest birds was used to, (1) identify biodiversity indicators in the middle and northern boreal zone, (2) test the effect of forest restoration practices on biodiversity indicators and (3) explore the patterns when biodiversity indicator analyses are performed across a wider range of forest types including both restored and unrestored sites. Additionally, to understand the occurrence of species we correlated their occurrence with local habitat structures across different forest types. We found that both the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) were important biodiversity indicators for the middle/northern boreal zone. The occurrence of these species can generally be used to identify species rich areas across different forest types. However, the three-toed woodpecker, the best indicator for unrestored forest, lost its indicator value after prescribed burning; in these stands the goldcrest (Regulus regulus) was the best biodiversity indicator. Based on habitat associations, we suggest that biodiversity indicators in boreal forest not only indicate high species richness but also structural habitat complexity. Our results draw attention to the fact that one must be careful about using previously identified biodiversity indicators in ecosystems subjected to ecological restoration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) associated squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region (HPV+ HNSCCs) harbor diverging biological features as compared to classical noxa-induced (HPV−) HNSCC. One striking difference between subtypes is that the tumor suppressor gene TP53 is usually not mutated in HPV+ HNSCCs. However, p53 is inhibited by viral oncoprotein E6, leading to premature proteasomal degradation. We asked whether bortezomib (BZM), a clinically approved inhibitor of the proteasome, can functionally restore p53 and investigated in how far this will result in an enhanced radio- or chemosensitivity of HPV+ HNSCC cell lines. For all four HPV+ cell lines tested, BZM led to functional restoration of p53 and transactivation of downstream protein p21. In HPV+ cells, BZM also restored the radiation-induced p53/p21 transactivation. Consistently, in HPV+ cells, a restored G1 arrest as well as enhanced apoptosis were seen when BZM was given prior to irradiation (IR) or cisplatin (CDDP). BZM alone reduced the clonogenic survival of both HPV− and HPV+ cells. However, if BZM was combined with IR or CDDP, BZM did not significantly enhance radio- or chemosensitivity of HPV+ or HPV− HNSCC cell lines. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Inverse problems appear in many applications, such as image deblurring and inpainting. The common approach to address them is to design a specific algorithm for each problem. The Plug-and-Play (PP) framework, which has been recently introduced, allows solving general inverse problems by leveraging the impressive capabilities of existing denoising algorithms. While this fresh strategy has found many applications, a burdensome parameter tuning is often required in order to obtain high-quality results. In this paper, we propose an alternative method for solving inverse problems using off-the-shelf denoisers, which requires less parameter tuning. First, we transform a typical cost function, composed of fidelity and prior terms, into a closely related, novel optimization problem. Then, we propose an efficient minimization scheme with a PP property, i.e., the prior term is handled solely by a denoising operation. Finally, we present an automatic tuning mechanism to set the method's parameters. We provide a theoretical analysis of the method and empirically demonstrate its competitiveness with task-specific techniques and the PP approach for image inpainting and deblurring. © 1992-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Dental cervical restorations may be impacted by resultants of occlusal loads that may have already contributed to the development of the lesion and should rely on materials’ favorable properties to bear the stresses. The marginal quality of cervical restorations made with materials of different moduli of elasticity in essence, isolated, or in combination, was evaluated relative to eccentric occlusal loading. Cervical wedge-shaped cavities, prepared in extracted premolars, were restored with a composite resin (CR), a restorative ionomer (GIC), or the composite in combination with a lining ionomer (Mixed restoration: M). Half of the teeth in each group were subjected to eccentric occlusal loading (eol; 150 N / 106 cycles / 2.5 Hz; CReol / GICeol / Meol, n = 10), and the others were stored in 37 °C distilled water (Control: c; CRc / GICc / Mc, n = 10). A fluorescein-modified adhesive favored delimitation of formed gaps, which were evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy regarding their presence, location related to the cavity walls, and width and depth (µm), at a 5% significance level. From a comprehensive perspective, neither the loading nor the materials were significantly associated with the qualitative response variables or exerted any influence over the quantitative variables. More specifically, the use of the different materials was significantly associated with the frequency of gaps exclusively when loading was applied (Chi-square test, p = 0.029, CR &gt; M &gt; GIC). Though the marginal quality of cervical restorations may not be influenced by eccentric occlusal loading or the use of different materials, even in association in general, the unfavorable aspects of the use of the composite may be relevant, particularly in face of the existence of eccentric occlusal loads. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ongoing climate change and frequent anomalous thermal events have greatly contributed to the deterioration of coral reefs worldwide, exacerbating declines in coral reef formation and ecosystem service provision. Under this climate change scenario, the development and improvement of restoration techniques will be required to cope with coral reef degradation. This study demonstrates the potential use of direct relocation of coral of opportunity as an effective long-term ecological restoration tool. We assessed coral growth parameters (cm yr−1), attachment rate (%), ecological volume (cm3 yr−1), including long-term evaluation of annual live coral cover (%) and calcium carbonate production (kg CaCO3 m−2 yr−1) during 5-years (2013–2018) using resilient branching coral Pocillopora spp. The results show a survivorship of 67%, high self-attachment (100%) during the first 6-months, and size augmentation of ∼167% in growth parameters (2.94–4.47 cm yr−1) and ∼418% in ecological volume. Over the long-term, live coral cover increased from 13 to 28% (+4% per year) with an accumulated carbonate production of 14.53 kg CaCO3 m−2 (∼3 kg CaCO3 m−2 yr−1) resulting from the restoration process, and we found evidence for high resistance and recovery after periods of thermal anomalies. The data validate the use of direct propagation of corals of opportunity as a one of the most feasible and practical techniques to long-term restoration of damaged and degraded coral reef areas, which may help in their structural rehabilitation, improving coral communities and biodiversity maintenance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the soil and water processes and their interactions over time and space has attracted research and policy attention worldwide. But past studies have rarely adopted an interdisciplinary approach to integrating the primary natural and social forces in assessing the causes of soil and water loss or conservation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of restoring degraded cropland by means of reestablishing forest/vegetation covers and terracing on water and sediment control in the Wei River Catchment, which was notorious for its high erosion rates but has witnessed tremendous improvement since the beginning of the new century. Based on a unique panel dataset covering 44 counties over a period of 16 consecutive years (2000–2015), our simultaneous equations model was able to capture the structural linkages between water runoff, sediment concentration, and sediment transport. To highlight the crucial role of human interventions, a stepwise regression approach was undertaken. Our empirical results show that the reduction of sediment concentration has been driven largely by improved land cover, induced by implementing the Sloping Land Conversion Program, whereas terracing, as part of the Water and Soil Conservation Project, has played a positive role in mitigating runoff and sediment discharge. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While the Chinese Grain for Green (GFG) policy has reduced the area of cultivated land in several regions in China, the program's effects on Per Unit Area Productivity of Cultivated Land (PAPCL) are not clear. As the positive or negative contributions of GFG to PAPCL can vary with context, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the correlations between the program and crop yields in order to determine the best balance between environmental benefits and food security. In this study, Wuqi County in China's Shaanxi Province was selected for a case study. Multi-source data were integrated in the Geographic Information System platform, and geographical weighted regression was then performed to spatially analyze the effects of the GFG on the improvement of PAPCL (GoP); with GoP as the dependent variable, we further analyzed the role of environmental variables in promoting the contribution of GFG to the improvement of PAPCL. Our findings are as follows: (1) GFG can better contribute to the PAPCL improvement in the villages with higher elevation, poor infrastructure, and denser populations, and thus, GFG could be further implemented in these areas. (2) In the area where GFG performed well, agricultural machinery and agricultural chemicals can be utilized less frequently, as they have similar effects on the improvement of PAPCL, but the increase of forest-based diseases and insect pests is possible. (3) The intensity of the GFG itself is negative compared to the GoP, which indicates that the implementation of the GFG in the study area may be excessive in improving the PAPCL. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Chronic pain significantly impairs physical, psychological and social functioning. Among military populations, pain due to injuries sustained both on and off the battlefield is a leading cause of short and long-term disability. Improving the quality of pain care for active duty service members is a major priority of the Department of Defense. This article describes an ongoing comparative effectiveness study which aims to (1) evaluate the benefit of a multimodal complementary and integrative health (CIH) pain management program when added to standard rehabilitative care (SRC) prior to an intensive functional restoration (FR) program compared to SRC alone, and (2) identify factors that predict improvement in pain impact following treatment completion. Using a randomized controlled trial design, active duty service members with pain related to musculoskeletal injury are assigned to a 3-week course of either SRC or SRC combined with CIH therapies prior to beginning a 3-week course of FR. Outcomes are collected at baseline, at the end of stage 1 treatment, post-FR, and at 3- and 6-months post-FR. Outcome measures include provider-measured functional assessments and patient-reported assessment through the Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR). The military health system provides a supportive environment for implementation of this research protocol. Challenges to conducting the study have included new technology systems at the study site, slower than projected enrollment, and program delivery issues. These challenges have been successfully managed and have not significantly impacted study participant enrollment and completion of study treatments. © 2018

AB  - In the arid and semi-arid areas, Carex Tussock had deteriorated and disappeared as a result of water deficit and salinization due to human activities and climate changes. A green house experiment was carried out to testify the restoration feasible of Carex Tussock in salinization area. We used a factorial design with two soil conditions (degraded soil occurred salinization and undisturbed soil), two Carex Tussocks (degraded ones resulted from soda-salinization and well ones) and three water levels (long-term drought, seasonal inundation and long-term inundation). In soda-saline soil, degraded Carex Tussock subjected to long-term drought died finally, and could not be revived even the stress was eliminated. Degraded Carex Tussock subjected to the other two water treatments and well Carex Tussock in all water condition went dormant status until environment was improved. However, in the undisturbed soil, except for degraded Carex Tussock under the long-term drought, others successfully survived to the end of experiments, and the degraded ones could be revived when water condition was improved. In undisturbed soil, height, leaf width, leaf area, chlorophyll content and biomass (fresh biomass and dry biomass) of well ones were better than degraded ones. Above results illustrated that it was not feasible to restore Carex Tussock in the soda-saline soils no matter by water condition improvement or well Carex Tussock transplanted. However, transplanting degraded or well Carex Tussock to undisturbed soil could establish successfully. Besides, natural Carex Tussock protection should be paid more attention to avoid soil salinization or secondary salinization. Once salinization or secondary salinization extensively occurred, the degeneration of Carex Tussock would be irreversible. © 2018

AB  - Recently, we have proposed a deep learning based heart sound recognition framework, which can provide high recognition performance under clean testing conditions. However, the recognition performance can notably degrade when noise is present in the recording environments. This study investigates a spectral restoration algorithm to reduce noise components from heart sound signals to achieve robust S1 and S2 recognition in real-world scenarios. In addition to the spectral restoration algorithm, a multi-style training strategy is adopted to train a robust acoustic model, by incorporating acoustic observations from both original and restored heart sound signals. We term the proposed method as SRMT (spectral restoration and multi-style training). The experimental procedure in this study is described as follows: First, an electronic stethoscope was used to record actual heart sounds, and the noisy signals were artificially generated at different signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs). Second, an acoustic model based on deep neural networks (DNNs) was trained using original heart sounds and heart sounds processed through spectral restoration. Third, the performance of the trained model was evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F-measure. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for recognizing heart sounds in noisy environments. The recognition results of an acoustic model trained on SRMT outperform that trained on clean data with a 2.36% average accuracy improvement (from 85.44% and 87.80%), over clean, 20dB, 15dB, 10dB, 5dB, and 0dB SNR conditions; the improvements are more notable in low SNR conditions: the average accuracy improvement is 3.87% (from 82.83% to 86.70%) in the 0dB SNR condition. © 2018

AB  - Water quality monitoring records were combined with geomorphic and stratigraphic data to determine the controls on suspended sediment transport dynamics within the headwaters of Big Harris Creek, the site of one of the largest stream restoration projects in North Carolina, USA. Land-use change associated with European settlement resulted in spatially variable geomorphic responses that produced reaches possessing semi-homogeneous landforms and processes, referred to as process zones. Downstream, process zones were dominated by entrenched channels possessing banks characterized by sandy post-settlement deposits that overlie finer-grained pre-settlement deposits. Spatial variations in the resulting process zones strongly influenced modern suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and loads in the catchment, which are among the highest reported for the southeastern United States. The source and transport dynamics of suspended sediment differed between low magnitude floods (characterized by minimal changes in water level elevations) and moderate to high magnitude floods. Low magnitude floods were characterized by SSCs that varied over several orders of magnitude, and that were unrelated to flow conditions. Precipitation, during these events, rapidly mobilization fine-grained pre-settlement deposits associated with bank failures and cattle crossings along entrenched alluvial channels. Moderate to high magnitude floods within larger tributary basins exhibited more systematic discharge-SSC relationships. Suspended sediment transport was dominated by sand-sized particles derived from post-settlement legacy sediments eroded from the channel banks and headwater gullies. The observed temporal and spatial differences in SSC between low and moderate to high magnitude floods complicates the quantification of water quality, and shows that comparisons of water quality before and following the implementation of restoration projects need to differentiate between distinct populations of suspended sediment transport. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Large river-floodplain systems are hotspots of biodiversity and ecosystem services but are also used for multiple human activities, making them one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. There is wide evidence that reconnecting river channels with their floodplains is an effective measure to increase their multi-functionality, i.e., ecological integrity, habitats for multiple species and the multiple functions and services of river-floodplain systems, although, the selection of promising sites for restoration projects can be a demanding task. In the case of the Danube River in Europe, planning and implementation of restoration projects is substantially hampered by the complexity and heterogeneity of the environmental problems, lack of data and strong differences in socio-economic conditions as well as inconsistencies in legislation related to river management. We take a quantitative approach based on best-available data to assess biodiversity using selected species and three ecosystem services (flood regulation, crop pollination, and recreation), focused on the navigable main stem of the Danube River and its floodplains. We spatially prioritize river-floodplain segments for conservation and restoration based on (1) multi-functionality related to biodiversity and ecosystem services, (2) availability of remaining semi-natural areas and (3) reversibility as it relates to multiple human activities (e.g. flood protection, hydropower and navigation). Our approach can thus serve as a strategic planning tool for the Danube and provide a method for similar analyses in other large river-floodplain systems. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The use of vegetation as a source of energy and its clearing for agricultural production has contributed to the degradation of the drylands in world. On soil, the effects of deforestation are still controversial and need to be better understood. In this study, the effect of deforestation and soil topography on soil morphological properties, nutrient availability, and carbon (C) contribution in a topossequence that was deforested 12 years before in the Brazilian semi-arid region was evaluated. For this purpose, two areas (preserved and deforested) were selected and separated into three positions along the slope: lower, middle, and upper third. For each position, the characterization of the soil fertility and the physical and morphological attributes of the selected profiles were carried out. In general, deforestation had no effect on the total organic carbon (TOC) of the soil, but, on the other hand, was responsible for increasing the structural fragility of the soil. The major effect of deforestation on soil fertility was reduced availability of cationic nutrients (Mg2+ and K+). We conclude that topography had no effect on the restoration of soil properties after deforestation in this semiarid ecosystem. For these conditions, similar management strategies (e.g. reforestation), can be adopted for the different topographical positions of the slope. Our results can be used in forest restoration projects of degraded ecosystems in drylands, to select the best practices of management, aiming at restoring the natural ecological processes of the ecosystem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Nonlocal Means (NLM) filter is a nonlinear filter exclusively suitable for images comprising redundant patterns at spatially distinct locations, like Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. However, its performance heavily depends on the selection of one of its arbitrary operational parameters termed as smoothening strength (ξ). Improper selection of ξ may lead to over-blurring or partial denoising. Objectives: An image adaptive algorithm, to determine the optimum value of ξ, meant for customizing the NLM for MR images is proposed. Methods: In the proposed scheme for initializing ξ, its value is increased in proportion to the standard deviation of noise σ^n, according to a linear model ξ=β σ^n. The optimum value of the arbitrary parameter β is identified through an iterative search, using a composite metric termed as Optimum Denoising Index (ODI), which objectively accounts for the noise suppression and edge preservation capability of the filter, as target function. Assuming the noise to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean, its standard deviation is computed using a ‘difference of Laplacian’ kernel. Results: The techniques available in literature for the selection of β are (i) Coupe's model with β derived out of minimum error sense, (ii) simple linear model ξ=βσ with empirically decided value β = 10 and global optimum of β modified locally in proportion to either (iii) local noise statistics or (iv) edge strength. ODI exhibited by the above techniques and the proposed iterative search are 0.3145 ± 0.0347, 0.2509 ± 0.0149, 0.1210 ± 0.0143, 0.1790 ± 0.0511 and 0.3678 ± 0.0022, respectively. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) between the denoised and the noise-free ground truth images exhibited by Kuwahara Filter, Total Variation (TV) Filter, Anisotropic Diffusion (AD) Filter, Bilateral Filter, SUSAN Filter and the proposed NLM Filter are 21.8739 ± 4.7310, 20.9596 ± 5.0518, 22.1553 ± 5.3369, 22.2142 ± 5.1275, 28.5628 ± 0.02 and 28.9967 ± 0.13, on 30 standard images. Conclusion: The iterative search is superior to methods available in literature with regard to the sharpness of the true morphological edges and smoothness of the homogenous regions in the denoised image. The proposed scheme of NLM is found to be superior to Kuwahara, TV, AD, Bilateral and SUSAN Filters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Overall survival of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has significantly improved with platinum-based salt treatments and recently with targeted therapies and immunotherapies. However, treatment failure occurs due to acquired or emerging tumor resistance. We developed a monoclonal antibody against the proform of neurotensin (LF-NTS mAb) that alters the homeostasis of tumors overexpressing NTSR1. Neurotensin is frequently overexpressed along with its high affinity receptor (NTSR1) in tumors from epithelial origins. This ligand/receptor complex contributes to the progression of many tumor types by activation of the cellular effects involved in tumor progression (proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion). We demonstrate that LF-NTS mAb operates on the plasticity of tumor cells overexpressing NTSR1 and lowers their aggressiveness. The mAb enables the restoration of platinum-based therapies responsiveness, while also decreasing metastatic processes. Efficacy dosage with long-term treatment showed no obvious adverse events, while demonstrating improvement in the performance status. Our data suggests that LF-NTS mAb is an ideal candidate to be safely added to the conventional standard of care in order to improve its efficacy. © 2018

AB  - The restoration of the Southeast Asian tropical forests is a global priority but is limited by a lack of experience and knowledge regarding tree species performance in the various micro-habitat conditions that are prevalent after disturbance. Here we study the survival, growth, susceptibility to damage and capacity to resprout of 38 Sumatran lowland tropical tree species in a restoration planting trial in several typical post-disturbance microhabitats. 3200 seedlings were planted in four two-hectare blocks in February 2013 at the Hutan Harapan Ecosystem Restoration concession in Sumatra, Indonesia, and subsequently censused every six-months for two years to assess performance and changes in microhabitat conditions. By the end of the experiment overall survival was only 41%, with damage incurred by 55% of the surviving plants. Habitat conditions (light/shade, presence/absence of bamboo and shrubs) and their interactions affected survival in complex ways. Bamboo negatively affected survival whereas shrubs had a positive effect, except where bamboo was also present. Height growth rate increased when sites were light-exposed. Individual species performances also differed across habitats. Defining a minimum threshold of 50% survival as a measure of success in different habitat types, only two species (A. pavonina and N. wallichiana) could be characterized as generalists. Eighteen other species were characterized as specialists with good performance in one-three habitat types. Our findings suggest that enhanced restoration success could be achieved through better species-site matching. © 2018

AB  - Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) is a network designed and planned to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and to protect biodiversity. Existing GBI designs lacked a systematic method to allocate restoration zones. This study proposes a novel approach for systematically selecting cost-effective areas for restoration on the basis of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and ecosystem condition to give an optimal spatial design of GBI. The approach was tested at a regional scale, in a transboundary setting encompassing the Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean in Andalusia (Spain) – Morocco (IBRM), across three aquatic ecosystems: freshwater, coastal and marine. We applied Marxan with Zones to stakeholder-defined scenarios of GBI in the IBRM. Specifically, we aimed to identify management zones within the GBl that addressed different conservation, restoration and exploitation objectives. Although almost all conservation targets were achieved, our results highlighted that the proportion of conservation features (i.e., biodiversity, ecosystem services) that would be compromised in the GBl, and the proportion of provisioning services that would be lost due to conservation (i.e., incidental representation) are potentially large, indicating that the probability of conflicts between conservation and exploitation goals in the area is high. The implementation of restoration zones improved connectivity across the GBI, and also achieved European and global policy targets. Our approach may help guide future applications of GBI to implement the flexible conservation management that aquatic environments require, considering many areas at different spatial scales, across multiple ecosystems, and in transboundary contexts. © 2018

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands are of great importance to European biodiversity. Their restoration in mountain regions often presents specific problems of raw soil stabilisation and difficult climatic conditions. Methods used to tackle these problems include increasing sowing density and fertilisation. However, past studies were performed at only one site or for a short time and do not clearly show how site traits and time affect restoration results. In six field experiments undertaken on raw soils in the Italian Alps, the effects of sowing density, fertilisation, soil, and climate on the development over time of plant density and cover were analysed over three to six years. The seed was collected from nearby grasslands and sown at rates of 335–21,410 seeds m−2. During the first one-two years, the percentage of seeds producing established plants at low seed rates was higher in stonier surfaces; however, at high rates a larger absolute plant number was recorded in finer soils. Two to five years after sowing, climatic conditions became more important. Full vegetation cover was achieved in all experiments. However, at high altitudes, individual plant cover became greater (and plant density decreased), probably because the grasses needed to accumulate more non-structural carbohydrates necessary to survive during the longer winter. Fertilisation accelerated the establishment of full vegetation cover by 1 to 3 years as it increased the mean cover per plant without affecting plant density. Grassland restoration is possible in mountain raw soils by using the seeds collected from nearby donor sites. High sowing densities are not required even in coarse or higher altitude soils because, in the short term, stones on the ground surface increase the percentage of seed producing established plants and, over the long term, plant density is not dependent on the sowing density. In low-fertile soils, fertilisation accelerates the establishment of full vegetation cover. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In central eastern Korea, there has been a continued effort to sustain pine forests because of their value for wood and mushroom production, as well as for other resources. Through the analysis of previously burned areas, we clarified the effects of fire on vegetation dynamics of pine forests by measuring changes in species composition, population structure, and the growth rates of major tree species. Vegetation analysis was conducted on a series of 100 m2 plots established in Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora Siebold. &amp; Zucc.) and Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch. Ex Ledeb.) forests situated in three different topographic positions on slopes where fire severity varied. We confirmed that most pine trees will succumb to even a surface fire, whereas oak may be killed following high intensity or infrequent fires but will sprout and become dominant. Complete protection from fire favors other, more shade-tolerant deciduous hardwoods. Different restoration plans apply, based on observed vegetation responses for each topographic zone. Near the ridge top, where pine seed sources are most limited, it may be necessary to restore pine forests by planting and to control competing shrubs and herbs. At the mountain foot, where exotic species and species modified by hybridization have invaded aggressively, restoration that involves the introduction of natural vegetation is required. Mid-slope sites, where pine has been replaced by natural vegetation dominated by Mongolian oak, do not require any form of restorative treatment. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Effective restoration of meadows requires seeds of local provenance to preserve not only the species diversity but also the genetic identity of plant communities. We compared three different methods of seed harvesting from local meadow communities and assessed their efficiency in meadow restoration on ex-arable land. These methods were: brush harvesting once only, brush harvesting three times during a season, and green hay transfer. We observed the composition of species and functional traits of seed source meadows, sampled the three harvested seed mixtures and monitored plant communities restored on ex-arable land with this seed over the five following years. Green hay transfer was the method producing the highest amount of seeds (expressed as mass) and the highest number of species per unit of source-meadow area, followed by brush harvesting three times during one season and once only, respectively. This resulted in the highest establishment rate of species on ex-arable land in the green hay transfer method, followed by brush harvesting three times during one season and once only, respectively. Across all methods, species abundant in the seed mixture, having a low specific leaf area and a low capacity for lateral clonal spread, were the most successfully harvested and established ones. In the restored communities, mainly species number and cover of legumes but also of target meadow species increased with time, while ruderal weedy species decreased. Concerning species number and composition as well as trait spectrum, green hay transfer was the most successful method of restoration, resulting in a community most similar to the seed source meadow. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anthropogenic, eco-morphological degradation of lotic waters necessitates laws, directives, and voluntary actions involving stream restoration and habitat enhancement. Research and engineering efforts are establishing a vast number of stream restoration planning approaches, design testing frameworks, construction techniques, and performance evaluation methods. As the practice of restoration scales up from an individual action at a single site to sequences of actions at many sites in a long river segment, a primary question arises as to the lifespan of such a sequence. This study develops a new framework to identify relevant parameters, design criteria and survival thresholds for ten multidisciplinary restoration techniques, adequate for site-scale to segment-scale application, in a comprehensive review: (1) bar and floodplain grading; (2) berm setback; (3) vegetation plantings; (4) riprap placement; (5) sediment replenishment; (6) side cavities; (7) side channel and anabranches; (8) streambed reshaping; (9) structure removal; and (10) placement of wood in the shape of engineered logjams and rootstocks. Survival thresholds are applied to a sequence of proposed habitat enhancement features for the lower Yuba River in California, USA. Spatially explicit hydraulic and sediment data, together with numerical model predictions of the measures, were vetted against the survival thresholds to produce discharge-dependent lifespan maps. Discharges related to specific flood-return periods enabled probabilistic estimates of the longevity of particular design features. Thus, the lifespan maps indicate the temporal stability of particular stream restoration and habitat enhancement features and techniques. Areas with particularly low or high lifespans help planners optimise the design and positioning of restoration features. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The concept of Ecosystem Service (ES) has provided an underpinning framework for ecological restoration research and applications. Ecological restoration is a corrective intervention that aims to reverse land degradation and to contribute to the 2030 Global Sustainable Development goal of Land Degradation Neutrality. It is critical to investigate the long-term effects of ecological restoration and land use change on ESs and ES interactions (synergies or trade-offs) to better understand the mechanisms supporting this goal. This paper describes an analysis of land use and ESs using historical data for a typical watershed in Chinese Loess Plateau, which has experienced series of restoration activities since the 1950s. Six important ESs (food provisioning, soil retention, hydrological regulation, carbon sequestration, water purification and habitat provisioning for biodiversity) were quantified at eight intervals between 1958 and 2015. The interactions between ESs were evaluated by correlation analysis. The results show that soil retention, carbon sequestration, water purification and habitat provisioning for biodiversity increased significantly across the different land use types over several decades but not hydrological regulation. The relationship between ESs was found to be variable over different time periods and a transition point between 1990 and 1995 was identified. Grassland was found to maintain greater water yield than woodland with high values of other ESs. The results suggest that trade-offs between ESs can be mitigated by adjusting the proportion of some important land use types (such as woodland and grassland). © 2018

AB  - Switzerland plans to restore 4000 km of rivers by 2090. Despite the immense investment costs, river restoration benefits have not been valued in monetary terms, and a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) does not exist for any river restoration project in Switzerland. We apply stated preference methods to elicit public preferences and willingness to pay for restoring two specific but representative river sites. The benefits of restoration are compared with its costs. Upscaling the results to the national level shows that the government budget allocated for river restoration (CHF 1200/m) is insufficient to cover the costs of local restoration projects. However, the surveyed local populations are willing to pay substantially more for restoring rivers in their area of residence than they are legally obliged to do. The CBA results demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the costs in the two case studies, and hence that restoration efforts are justified from an economic point of view. A sensitivity analysis shows that the main results and conclusions do not change when we change some of the key assumptions underlying the CBA. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Forest regeneration in abandoned pastures in Amazonia has been well studied, but active restoration of non-resilient pastures has not. In this work, we evaluated large-scale active restoration of intensively used pastures in southern Amazonia, where the highest deforestation rates are observed. With the construction of the Jirau Dam in the Madeira river (state of Rondônia, Brazil), a 3000-ha forest buffer zone has been established. This area was previously covered by African pasture grasses for cattle ranching. Eight mixed-species planting sites with variable grass management and ranging from 6 to 60 months post-planting were measured three times over 2.5 years. We also tested a gradient of restoration intensity in an experimental planting: (i) no intervention (control), (ii) harrowing and herbicides to control grasses, and (iii) harrowing and herbicides plus tree planting. Our goals were to understand the initial trajectory of actively restored sites, the role of harrowing and herbicide application in triggering natural regeneration, and the role of seedling planting on the initial vegetation structure. All tree species ≥30 cm in height were sampled in five circular 10-m-radius plots per site. Plant cover was also monitored using the step-point method. At 18 months, stem density ranged from 2500 to 14,490 ind·ha−1, demonstrating that density increased suddenly in most sites through colonization, although this was highly variable. Tree cover reached 81% in five years, virtually eliminating grass cover after 36 months. Recruits contributed more to basal area than planted seedlings. Although 17 species, on average, were planted in restoration sites, the number of species at the sites steadily increased over time, at a rate of 7 species·yr−1 per 1570 m2. Cecropia spp. and Trema micrantha recruits had the highest stem densities and basal areas. Harrowing and grass control were enough to trigger succession in sites where natural regeneration was not taking place, shifting these sites to the highly resilient route of early secondary forest succession in the Amazon. Future restoration efforts should use a combination of methods, first evaluating the potential for natural regeneration and then gradually eliminating barriers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Three Rivers Source Region, in the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has a sensitive and fragile ecological environment. Adverse changes in climate and human activities have degraded the grassland ecosystems. To mitigate or reverse the degradation, alleviate rural poverty, and stimulate economic development, ecological restoration projects have been implemented. In the present study, our goal was to assess the ecological and socioeconomic effects of these programs based on land-use change, grassland NPP, and household surveys. Household data were collected using structured questionnaires in 11 villages from three counties, with average elevation above 3773 m asl. We found that the grassland degradation had been mitigated, especially after the implementation of ecological restoration programs since 2005 in a regional nature reserve in Qinghai Province. Household income depends strongly on the region's natural resources, so the grassland ecosystems are still at risk of unsustainable use. A household that understood the effects of the ecological restoration programs and had received training to participate in the programs was more willing to participate in future programs. Our findings suggest that for successful restoration, it is essential to help residents of the study area thoroughly understand the ecological restoration programs and learn the restoration techniques before implementation of such programs. This is because the participation of the residents depended strongly on both their income and their satisfaction with the ecological restoration programs. © 2018

AB  - Vegetation restoration was implemented to control soil erosion in the karst regions of southwest China. It is essential to assess the soil function and quality scientifically during this process and to adopt suitable management practices for this area. However, few studies have been conducted to comprehensively evaluate the effect of vegetation restoration on soil quality in this severely eroded karst area. By taking 302 soil samples from 11 vegetation types, this study investigated the influence of different types of vegetation restoration on soil quality using an integrated soil quality index (SQI) and a generalized linear model (GLM). Vegetation types had significant effects on soil properties and thus on soil quality. SQI was developed by using TN, TP, TK, AP, and clay content; TN had highest weighting values (0.58), which indicated that it contributed the most to final SQI. The highest and lowest SQI values were observed for primary forest and cropland, respectively. Overall, vegetation restoration (e.g., natural restoration, artificial forests and artificial grassland) improved soil quality significantly. A GLM model explained 73.20% of the total variation in SQI, and vegetation type explained the largest proportion (46.39%) of the variation, which implies that the vegetation restoration practices can greatly enhance the soil quality in karst landscapes of southwest China. The results of this study may be used to improve implication of ecological restoration and management in degraded regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vegetation restoration often has a significant effect on the supply of an ecosystem service (ES). Assessment of this effect is crucial for informed decision-making in sustainable ecosystem management. In this respect, this study analyses three regulating, two provisioning, and a single cultural ES over a 30-year period (1985 to 2015, with 15 years pre-restoration and 15 years post-restoration) in the Loess Plateau, China, using data from a combination of modelling and statistical yearbooks. On applying a suite of standard statistical tools, results indicate: (1) regional scale restoration promotes the increase of vegetation cover as the coverage increased faster between 2000 and 2015 than between 1985 and 2000; (2) vegetation restoration changes the temporal trend of regulating ESs, and enhances the supply of provisioning and cultural ESs; (3) the 40 municipalities of the Loess Plateau can be divided into four ES categories where areas with poor ES delivery account for about 30% of the Loess Plateau; (4) vegetation restoration changes the interaction among ESs, resulting in synergistic relationships between provisioning and regulating ESs; (5) precipitation has a significant impact on regulating ESs, while population density is critical for provisioning and cultural ESs. This study demonstrates that ESs, their interactions and their groupings can change across both time and space following the implementation of a vegetation restoration programme, which makes understanding ES dynamics complicated. Recommendations are provided for improved and coherent ecosystem management. © 2018

AB  - Biodiversity is an important ecosystem characteristic, and is vital for maintaining ecosystem health and stability. However, biodiversity was often ignored in previous Chinese restoration planning and design due to its complex roles and the unclear mechanisms in providing human well-being. In order to evaluate the response of biodiversity to ecological restoration in terrestrial ecosystems, we assembled biodiversity in different metrics and different organisms and generated a large dataset comprised 2099 observations from 103 published studies to conduct a meta-analysis in China. Our results revealed that the biodiversity of restored ecosystem increased by 43% compared with degraded state, but it was difficult to recover to the natural level across the whole China. The gap between restored and natural ecosystems was about 13%. Ecological restorations have contributed not only to increasing vegetation coverage but also to improving soil environment and habitat quality. The recovery levels of vascular plant, soil microorganism and soil invertebrate were 30%, 73% and 48%, respectively. Biodiversity recovery would be better reflected in enhancing the structure feature (65%) such as plant height and density rather than the diversity feature (18%) such as diversity indices of Shannon and Simpson. Moreover, the response of biodiversity to ecological restoration varied with restoration actions (i.e., initial land use/cover type, restoration approach and restoration age), and the interaction effects among restoration actions significantly impacted biodiversity recovery. Passive approach performed better than active approach for biodiversity recovery. Meanwhile, the magnitude and direction of the impact of ecological restoration on biodiversity greatly altered with environmental conditions (i.e., climate condition and altitude). Our findings could facilitate priority setting and selection of treatment methods for biodiversity recovery during ecological restoration planning and assessment to ensure high effectiveness and sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plant domestication can modify flavonoid concentration, generating a decrease in plants subjected to cultivation, but when cultivated plants are transferred to their original wild area, flavonoids can be recovered. In this framework, a native shrub from Chile, Ugni molinae, has been domesticated due to their high phenolic composition. We hypothesised that plant domestication results in a decrease of flavonoid in cultivated plants, and that when they are exposed to a reciprocal transplant experiment, the flavonoid content can be recovered. Hence, a reciprocal transplant experiment for analysing the flavonoids of cultivated plants transferred to their original wild environments was carried out. Methanolic leaf extracts from two cultivated ecotypes and their respectively wild ancestors were collected for flavonoid analysis. Four flavonols and two isoflavonoids were identified and quantified by liquid chromatography. Results showed differences in flavonoids concentrations between wild (290 µg/g) and cultivated (160 µg/g) plants. Furthermore, when wild plants were transferred to cultivated areas, a reduction in flavonoids of 80 µg/g was observed. Moreover, rutin was the most abundant compound (36.09%) detected by chromatography in Mehuín wild plants. Our results showed that cultivated plants transferred to their respective wild environment presented a capacity of recover myricetin, daidzin and genistin content. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Recreational fishing activity has recovered in the Nerbioi estuary (Northern Spain), after water sanitation and environmental improvement. Recreational fishing is important for the local population; therefore, future management measures that could cause changes in the estuary should also consider the impacts on recreational fishing. Our objective was to analyze the effects that future management decisions and unexpected environmental changes, alone or in combination with climate change effects, can produce in recreational fishing in Nerbioi. The current recreational fishing activity was modelled using a System Dynamics Modelling (SDM). Based on those results, seven future scenarios were simulated. Results suggested that the adoption of future management measures to improve the environmental conditions could lead to additional positive changes for recreational fishing, as after water quality improvement, fish stocks will continue to recover, and these better conditions could attract more fishers and increase their satisfaction. Simulation of temporary and unexpected environmental changes resulted in quick estuarine recovery, without dramatic consequences for recreational fishing. In conclusion, analysing future scenarios on cultural ecosystem services such as recreational fishing, using SDM, can produce valuable information for decision making processes, facilitating the selection between environmental management alternatives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The influence of 0.01–2 mol% Fe2O3 powder addition on the microstructure, mechanical and optical properties, and hydrothermal stability of highly-translucent 3Y-TZP ceramics is assessed and compared with commercially available co-precipitated 0.18 mol% Fe2O3 doped ZrO2 powder-based ceramics. Only those ceramics with up to 0.1 mol% Fe2O3 resulted in a proper shade for dental zirconia ceramics, with a typical composition of 87 vol% t-ZrO2 and 13 vol% c-ZrO2. The amount of cubic phase increased at higher Fe2O3 content. The hardness (∼13 GPa) and fracture toughness (∼3.6 MPa m1/2) of the 0.01 mol% - 0.1 mol% Fe2O3 doped 3Y-TZP was comparable, whereas the hardness decreased above 0.5 mol% Fe2O3 and the fracture toughness decreased above 2 mol% Fe2O3. The hydrothermal ageing resistance slightly increased for Fe2O3 concentrations up to 1 mol%, whereas the translucency slightly decreased with increasing Fe2O3 content. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since its first announcement in 2002 and completion in 2005, restoration of Cheonggyecheon, an urban stream in downtown Seoul, South Korea, has drawn great interest internationally and locally as a model achievement of sustainable development and has triggered extensive empirical research thereafter. This study questions whether the restoration of Cheonggyecheon is sustainable. Using a systematic literature review that combines thematic synthesis and realist review, this study establishes a framework composed of the three Es of sustainable development (environment, economy, and equity) and their 36 dimensions as suggested by literature. Based on the framework, 86 studies published between 2003 and 2017 are reviewed. Results suggest that environmental sustainability is the most studied, while economic sustainability has received the least academic interest. Its equity aspect remains controversial. Overall, it is difficult to confirm Cheonggyecheon's sustainability. Many of its sustainability dimensions require further investigation, and research findings remain mixed or unclear. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Open-pit mining activities can cause serious disturbance to the local land and even regional vegetation communities. Vegetation restoration is a crucial approach for maintaining ecological stability in a post-mining area. In this study, the role of the environment factors on vegetation diversity under different restoration years (2a, 5a, 10a and control area) in the largest phosphate mining areas in Southwestern China was evaluated by a multi-model inference (MMI) based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Three competing models of environmental factors included vegetation nutrient content (M1), soil heavy metal content (M2) and human disturbance (M3) were constructed to analyze how they impact vegetation diversity. The results revealed the changing effects of different environmental factors under four restoration stages. Heavy metal content in the soil (M2) had the strongest effect on vegetation diversity in the restoration areas at 2 and 10 years, whereas human disturbance (M3) had the strongest effect in the restoration area at 5 years. In the control area, the vegetation nutrient content (M1) had the strongest effect on vegetation diversity. According to the different models, a comprehensive index of environmental factors (CIEF) was established to build the fitting formula with vegetation diversity. The index could be used for assessing the efficiency of vegetation restoration by comparing the theoretical value and the actual value of Shannon's diversity index in the study area and other phosphate mining areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Monitoring and evaluating forest restoration projects is a challenge especially in large-scale, but the remote monitoring of indicators with the use of synoptic, multispectral and multitemporal data allows us to gauge the restoration success with more accurately and in small time. The objective of this study was to elaborate and compare methods of remote monitoring of forest restoration using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and multispectral imaging from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) camera, in addition to comparing the efficiency of supervised classification algorithms Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Random Forest (RF). The study was carried out in a restoration area with about 74 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A., in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, Near Infrared) on UAV and LIDAR data composition (intensity image, Digital Surface Model, Digital Terrain Model, normalized Digital Surface Model). The monitored restoration indicator was the land cover separated in three classes: canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the ML and RF algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifications, the Overall Accuracy (OA) and the Kappa index were used, and the last was compared by Z test. The area occupied by different land cover classes was calculated using ArcGIS and R. The results of OA, Kappa and visual evaluation of the images were excellent in all combinations of the imaging methods and algorithms analyzed. When Kappa values for the two algorithms were compared, RF presented better performance than ML with significant difference, but when sensors (UAV camera and LIDAR) were compared, there were no significant differences. There was little difference between the area occupied by each land cover classes generated by UAV and LIDAR images. The highest cover was generated for canopy cover followed by grass cover and bare soil in all classified images, indicating the need of adaptive management interventions to correct the area trajectory towards the restoration success. The methods employed in this study are efficient to monitor restoration areas, especially on a large scale, allowing us to save time, fieldwork and invested resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although experiences with ecological restoration continue to accumulate, the effectiveness of restoration for biota remains debated. We complemented a traditional taxonomic analysis approach with information on 56 species traits to uncover the responses of 3 aquatic (fish, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes) and 2 terrestrial (carabid beetles, floodplain vegetation) biotic groups to 43 hydromorphological river restoration projects in Germany. All taxonomic groups responded positively to restoration, as shown by increased taxonomic richness (10–164%) and trait diversity (habitat, dispersal and mobility, size, form, life history, and feeding groups) (15–120%). Responses, however, were stronger for terrestrial than aquatic biota, and, contrary to our expectation, taxonomic responses were stronger than those of traits. Nevertheless, trait analysis provided mechanistic insights into the drivers of community change following restoration. Trait analysis for terrestrial biota indicated restoration success was likely enhanced by lateral connectivity and reestablishment of dynamic processes in the floodplain. The weaker response of aquatic biota suggests recovery was hindered by the persistence of stressors in the aquatic environment, such as degraded water quality, dispersal constraints, and insufficient hydromorphological change. Therefore, river restoration requires combined local- and regional-scale approaches to maximize the response of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Due to the contrasting responses of aquatic and terrestrial biota, the planning and assessment of river restoration outcomes should consider effects on both components of riverine landscapes. © 2018 Society for Conservation Biology

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aim of this study is to verify the potential advantages and benefits of bone-marrow derived autologous stem cells implantation associated to surgical left ventricular restoration (SVR), to report a new modality of cell delivery to myocardium, and to identify possible side effects of this procedure. METHODS: Between March 2007 and March 2013, 30 patients affected by ischemic dilative cardiomyopathy who received a SVR operation were enrolled in the study. The population was divided in two groups:16 patients were randomly assigned to receive stem cells therapy in addition to SVR (groupA), 14 patients received a placebo (group B). The two groups were homogeneous in respect of age, gender, preoperative NYHA class, mitral incompetence and left ventricular sizes and volumes. The patients were evaluated by echo and pet-scan before surgery and at 6 months follow-up, and by echo at subsequent follow-up. RESULTS: Overall 30 days-in hospital mortality was 0 for the entire cohort. At last follow-up ejection fraction increased from 25.3% before surgery to 36.3% in group A, and from 31.8% to 45.6% in group B. Reduction of LVEDD was 6% in group A, 9% in group B. ESLVV and EDLVD decreased more significantly in patients receiving stem cells (55% vs. 35%). Late cardiac mortality at 9 years follow-up was similar in the two groups of patients. No early or late adverse reaction nor cases of infections were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients affected by ischemic cardiomyopathy have a favourable outcome after SVR. Ahigher reduction of LVEDV and LVESV assessed by CT-Scan evaluation in patients receiving cell therapy, when compared to control group, encourages the evolution and refinement of myocardial regenerative therapy added to SVR. © 2018 EDIZIONIMINERVAMEDICA.

AB  - The authors note that some unclear descriptions were made during publication of this paper. The corrected sections are clarified below. The authors declare that the results and conclusions of this paper were unaffected by the corrections. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. Section 2.2, paragraph 1 This paragraph should be replaced by the following: “Based on our previous report (Hu et al. 2015), the revegetation approach using transplanted soil cores containing corms of S. mariqueter on the tidal flats is more successful than that with seed-planting and seedling-planting approaches. In April of 2014, three levels of planting densities were applied in the mud-dominated site (M): low – one soil core per 1 m2, medium – two soil cores per 1 m2 and high – four soil cores per 1 m2. Revegetation area of 20 m × 20 m at the M site for each treatment of planting density was set up at the bare mudflat (Hu et al. 2015). In November of 2014, the high density planting (four soil cores per 1 m2) was applied at the silt-dominated site (S) with area of 5 m × 5 m. The stainless-steel tubes (inner diameter of 7.5 cm) were used to dig the intact soil cores (depth of 15 cm) from the original S. mariqueter communities as the planting material. There were on average 15 corms in these transplanted soil cores that were used for revegetation practice. The planting approach and the two sites (Fig. 1) with different sediment properties were used as the experimental design for the research presented here into SOC and SN.” Section 2.4, paragraph 2, sentences 2 This should be replaced by: “In December of 2016, the plant and soil materials in the S-YH plot were further sampled with the same method for the biomass and stocks of SOC and SN. However, at that time the plot was totally occupied by the expansion of surrounding Scirpus plants. In order to avoid the uncertainty due to mixture of recently restored and newly expanding plants, the data were not included in this study.” © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccine is a microorganism developed as a vaccine for tuberculosis 100 years ago and used as therapy for bladder cancer 40 years ago. More recently, BCG has shown therapeutic promise for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and several other autoimmune diseases. In T1D, BCG restored blood sugars to near normal, even in patients with advanced disease of >20 years duration. This clinically important effect may be driven by resetting of the immune system and the shifting of glucose metabolism from overactive oxidative phosphorylation, a state of minimal sugar utilization, to aerobic glycolysis, a state of high glucose utilization, for energy production. The mechanistic findings support the Hygiene Hypothesis and reveal the immune and metabolic synergy of mycobacterial reintroduction in modern humans. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wetland restoration is a major objective of environmental management worldwide. We present a frameworkat the regional level that prioritizes historical biodiversity and restoration suitability. The goal of the framework is to maximize biodiversity gains from restoration while minimizing the cost. We used C-Plan, a prioritization tool for systematic conservation planning (SCP), to balance the biodiversity gains withthe costs of restoration, or restoration suitability. We overlaid historical spatial data from 1995 to estimate historical distributions of 91 biodiversity features. These features were used to conduct an irreplaceability analysis to assess the restoration value of historical biodiversity. We then modelled restoration suitability based on environmental data of six criteria. Finally, we applied a complementarity analysis to achieve the quantitative targets of all biodiversity features while minimizing the cost of restoration. We tested this framework in the highly degraded wetlands ofSanjiang Plain, China. By applying our framework to Sanjiang Plain, we successfully identified areas with both high restoration value and high restoration suitability. The area of this cost-effective plan was an extension of 4620 km2, covering 80% of the disappearing wetlands and 4% of the total Sanjiang Plain. Compared to the restoration value-only plan, which had an extension of 4486 km2, the cost-effective plan covered a little more area to achievethe targets forall biodiversity features but with lower implementation costs where the proportion of high restoration suitability increases from 43% to 50%.Our prioritization framework can be used to analyse regional restoration efforts in other regions and ecosystems, and inform planners on how to maximize biodiversity gains while minimizing costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the development of information transmission technology and computer technology, information acquisition mode is mainly converted from character to image nowadays. However, in the process of acquiring and transmitting images, image damage and quality decrease due to various factors. Therefore, how to restore image has become a research hotspot in the field of image processing. This paper establishes an image restoration model based on BP neural network. The simulation results show that the proposed method has made a great improvement compared with the traditional image restoration method. © 2019

AB  - Restoring hazy images is challenging since it must account for several physical factors that are related to the image formation process. Existing analytical methods can only provide partial solutions because they rely on assumptions that may not be valid in practice. This research presents an effective method for restoring hazy images based on genetic programming. Using basic mathematical operators several computer programs that estimate the medium transmission function of hazy scenes are automatically evolved. Afterwards, image restoration is performed using the estimated transmission function in a physics-based restoration model. The proposed estimators are optimized with respect to the mean-absolute-error. Thus, the effects of haze are effectively removed while minimizing overprocessing artifacts. The performance of the evolved GP estimators given in terms of objective metrics and a subjective visual criterion, is evaluated on synthetic and real-life hazy images. Comparisons are carried out with state-of-the-art methods, showing that the evolved estimators can outperform these methods without incurring a loss in efficiency, and in most scenarios achieving improved performance that is statistically significant. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work deals with the application of archaeological methods and modern methodologies of point clouds survey to structural analysis, with the purpose of creating a series of products, such as Elevation Maps, Orthophotos, 3D Models, in order to highlight the building and mechanical past of the examined buildings and to further the knowledge of the territory's seismic history. These products are to be used as a base for the study of the cognitive process of the material structure, the constructive techniques and the restoration of a specific context, of importance for future vulnerability and restoration analyses. The present paper will focus on the trinomial “technology-archaeoseismology-earthquakes” in order to bring to the attention of the scientific community the advantages and critical issues of an innovative point of view. The historical center of Florence and, specifically, the church of San Remigio, has been chosen as a case study to illustrate the methodology. © 2018

AB  - Removal of cyprinid fish is a widely used biomanipulation tool to transform turbid shallow eutrophic lakes in north temperate regions into a clear water state. We here evaluate the removal of cyprinids from streams as a supplement to lake fishing. Since cyprinids often aggregate in high densities in lake inlet/outlet streams during winter migration, removal of fish in this space-confined habitat may be cost-efficient as compared to fish removal in the lake habitat. In two consecutive years, we annually removed up to 35% of the dominant cyprinids from an inlet stream to a lake and argue that this could easily be increased with a more targeted fishing effort. Concurrently, we monitored species- and length-specific variation in migration propensity, to explore how this relates to efficient fish removal. Smaller planktivores generally had a much higher migratory propensity than larger benthivores. Hence, stream fishing specifically targets species and size groups that are less efficiently controlled with traditional lake fishing methods. As a rule of thumb, stream fishing is most efficient when water temperature is 2–6°C. Prior to implementing fish removals from streams, the potential evolutionary consequences of the targeted removal of migratory phenotypes should be considered. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study evaluated the fatigue failure load, number of cycles for failure and survival probability of 2nd and 3rd generation yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) adhesively cemented to a dentin analogue substrate. Disc-shaped specimens (n = 10; Ø = 10 mm; thickness = 1.0 mm) were produced from four 2nd generation YSZs (Lava Plus, 3M ESPE; Vita In-Ceram YZ-HT, VITA Zahnfabrik; Zirlux FC, Ivoclar Vivadent; Katana ML-HT, Kuraray) and two 3rd generation YSZs (Katana UTML and Katana STML, Kuraray). Each YSZ disc was adhesively cemented (Multilink Automix System) onto its dentin analogue pair (epoxy resin, Ø = 10 mm; thickness = 2.5 mm). Fatigue tests were conducted through step-stress approach (load ranging from 400 to 2600 N; step-size of 200 N; 20,000 cycles per step, 20 Hz) and the obtained data were analyzed using Kaplan Meier and Mantel-Cox tests. Surface topography and phase transformation (m-, t-, and c-phases) inspections after particle air-abrasion of the YSZs were performed, as well as fractographic analysis of the failed specimens. Second-generation zirconia materials presented higher fatigue failure load, number of cycles for failure, and survival probability than 3rd generation. Similar topographical characteristics of the YSZs could be noted. Phase transformation (t- to m-phase) after YSZ air-abrasion was only observed for 2nd generation materials. All failures started from the surface/sub-surface defects located at the cementation interface. 2nd generation zirconia presented higher load-bearing capacity under cyclic loading than 3rd generation materials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - China has made considerable efforts to mitigate the pollution of lakes over the past decade, but the success rate of these restoration actions at a national scale remains unclear. The present study compiled a 13-year (2005–2017) comprehensive dataset consisting of 24,319 records from China's 142 lakes and reservoirs. We developed a novel Water Quality Index (WQI-DET), customized to China's water quality classification scheme, to investigate the spatio-temporal pollution patterns. The likelihood of regime shifts during our study period is examined with a sequential algorithm. Our analysis suggests that China's lake water quality has improved and is also characterized by two WQI-DET abrupt shifts in 2007 and 2010. However, we also found that the eutrophication problems have not been eradicated and heavy metal (HM) pollution displayed an increasing trend. Our study suggests that the control of Cr, Cd and As should receive particular attention in an effort to alleviate the severity of HM pollution. Priority strategies to control HM pollution include the reduction of the contribution from mining activities and implementation of soil remediation in highly polluted areas. The mitigation efforts of lake eutrophication are more complicated due to the increasing importance of internal nutrient loading that can profoundly modulate the magnitude and timing of system response to external nutrient loading reduction strategies. We also contend that the development of a rigorous framework to quantify the socioeconomic benefits from well-functioning lake and reservoir ecosystems is critically important to gain leeway and keep the investments to the environment going, especially if the water quality improvements in many Chinese lakes and reservoirs are not realized in a timely manner. © 2018

AB  - Conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems is increasingly important due to negative impacts caused by expanding human populations, changing land use, and climate change. Understanding drivers of system processes supports efficient restoration and successful conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems. We describe a long-term forest monitoring program established as a component of a long-term ecological monitoring approach and used in conjunction with adaptive management to actively restore a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) system. Eight panels of 108 monitoring points were selected within our 11,740 ha study area near Newton, GA, USA using a Random Tessellation Stratified design with hierarchical randomization. Each year two panels were sampled, resulting in a complete survey of all points every four years. To date, data have been collected over four sampling intervals (2002–2017). Collected data included basic forestry measurements and quantification of understory conditions. For an initial analysis of the data, we calculated estimates and error of average volume, change in volume, mortality, diameter distribution, and ingrowth. Additionally, we compared effects of management practices, which varied between plots, on these estimates. The tree volume on the study area is comprised primarily of longleaf pine with ∼80% of this volume from trees ≥34 cm DBH. Pine tree volume increased by 13.29 (±2.03) m3/ha between Intervals 1 and 4. Pine mortality during each sample interval was relatively stable over the study period, 2.98 (±0.39) - 4.56% (±0.58), and primarily attributed to timber harvest. Management activities resulted in increased longleaf pine ingrowth and reduced hardwood volume. Our analyses indicate that through our management actions we have successfully made progress towards achieving our overall restoration goals for the site. Data collected from the long-term monitoring program were also used to provide information for scientific studies regarding water conservation in longleaf pine systems and wildlife-habitat relationships. As monitoring progresses, collected data will be used to assess progress and guide further restoration using adaptive management and dynamic reference models. © 2018

AB  - Image restoration methods aim to recover the underlying clean image from corrupted observations. The expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL) algorithm is a powerful image restoration method that uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior on the patches of natural images. Although it is very effective for restoring images, its high runtime complexity makes the EPLL ill-suited for most practical applications. In this paper, we propose three approximations to the original EPLL algorithm. The resulting algorithm, which we call the fast-EPLL (FEPLL), attains a dramatic speed-up of two orders of magnitude over EPLL while incurring a negligible drop in the restored image quality (less than 0.5 dB). We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our algorithm on a number of inverse problems, such as denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and devignetting. To the best of our knowledge, the FEPLL is the first algorithm that can competitively restore a 512× 512 pixel image in under 0.5 s for all the degradations mentioned earlier without specialized code optimizations, such as CPU parallelization or GPU implementation. © 1992-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Chemical and biological functioning of artificial wetlands and lakes in alluvial plains is investigated based on the example of small artificial ponds located within dike fields along the Rhône River (France). The objective is to identify the diversity of metabolism in these artificial aquatic ecosystems and to propose a functional classification linked to the connectivity with the river. A comprehensive characterization of chemical and biological parameters in six shallow ponds was conducted, along with 4-month continuous monitoring of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration, both in the sub-surface and at depth. Metabolism intensity is quantified using the diel oxygen method. Multivariate analysis of chemical and biological characteristics is performed to identify the functional heterogeneity between the ponds, which is shown to be consistent with the intensity of primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). Some ponds are permanently connected to the river, like backwater, and are very turbid, because of suspended matter and the presence of phytoplankton. The oxygenation is limited to the surface layer with anoxia rapidly building up at the bottom due to an intense ER. Ponds that are rarely connected become eutrophic with large concentration of phytoplankton and large GPP and ER values. Anoxia and even denitrification occur close to the bottom sediment. Finally, in the ponds with intermediate degree of connection with the river, macrophytes grow in clear water with limited amount of phytoplankton, resulting in a gradient of GPP and ER values, controlled by nutrient availability. Rehabilitation of various connection patterns with the river is thus crucial to maintain a functional diversity in large river alluvial plains. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental flow, one of the main restoration measures for regulated rivers, aims to restore and sustain degraded riparian ecosystems and the human wellbeing that depends on these ecosystems with a reasonable magnitude, frequency, duration and timing of water flow. However, efficacies of environmental flows are often restrained by other demands along the river and inappropriate water management, leading to only spatially limited habitats being suitable for ecosystem functioning. This paper presents current restoration measures in the lower reaches of the Tarim riparian ecosystem in Northwest China and analyzes ecohydrological dynamics as a function of environmental flows. The groundwater level oscillation before/after and during the environmental flows (i.e., manmade water diversion) was examined, and the Mann-Kendall test was applied to identify the overall trend of change in groundwater depth from 2003 to 2011. The growth, distribution, health status (referred to as “vitality”) and renewal potentials of the dominant tree species Populus euphratica were quantified by using individual-based repeated measurements of P. euphratica morphology in two sampling sites (a 100-ha permanent plot and five random sampling plots with 50-m radii) at Arghan village in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. Based on these measurements, the effects of restoration measures on the groundwater recharge and the revitalization of degraded trees were assessed. The main contribution and achievements of the water diversion project on rehabilitation of the degraded riparian forests were evaluated; further, the limitations and challenges faced by of the restoration project were examined. The results of this research could help establish a reference for monitoring changes in riparian forests in Central Asia and possibly recommend restoration measures for riparian forest ecosystems in arid regions worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increasing human pressure on strongly defaunated ecosystems is characteristic of the Anthropocene and calls for proactive restoration approaches that promote self-sustaining, functioning ecosystems. However, the suitability of novel restoration concepts such as trophic rewilding is still under discussion given fragmentary empirical data and limited theory development. Here, we develop a theoretical framework that integrates the concept of ‘ecological memory’ into trophic rewilding. The ecological memory of an ecosystem is defined as an ecosystem's accumulated abiotic and biotic material and information legacies from past dynamics. By summarising existing knowledge about the ecological effects of megafauna extinction and rewilding across a large range of spatial and temporal scales, we identify two key drivers of ecosystem responses to trophic rewilding: (i) impact potential of (re)introduced megafauna, and (ii) ecological memory characterising the focal ecosystem. The impact potential of (re)introduced megafauna species can be estimated from species properties such as lifetime per capita engineering capacity, population density, home range size and niche overlap with resident species. The importance of ecological memory characterising the focal ecosystem depends on (i) the absolute time since megafauna loss, (ii) the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover, (iii) the strength of species interactions characterising the focal ecosystem, and (iv) the compensatory capacity of surrounding source ecosystems. These properties related to the focal and surrounding ecosystems mediate material and information legacies (its ecological memory) and modulate the net ecosystem impact of (re)introduced megafauna species. We provide practical advice about how to quantify all these properties while highlighting the strong link between ecological memory and historically contingent ecosystem trajectories. With this newly established ecological memory–rewilding framework, we hope to guide future empirical studies that investigate the ecological effects of trophic rewilding and other ecosystem-restoration approaches. The proposed integrated conceptual framework should also assist managers and decision makers to anticipate the possible trajectories of ecosystem dynamics after restoration actions and to weigh plausible alternatives. This will help practitioners to develop adaptive management strategies for trophic rewilding that could facilitate sustainable management of functioning ecosystems in an increasingly human-dominated world. © 2018 Cambridge Philosophical Society

AB  - Exposure to nature can strengthen an individual’s sense of connectedness (i.e., emotional/cognitive bonds to the natural world) and enhance psychological restoration (e.g., feeling relaxed/refreshed). To date, there have been few large studies looking at the role that type and quality of natural environments may have on these outcomes. The present study used data from a large survey in England (sample analyzed = 4,515), which asked participants to recall a recent visit to nature. After controlling for covariates, respondents recalled greater connectedness to nature and restoration following visits to rural and coastal locations compared with urban green space, and to sites of higher environmental quality (operationalized by protected/designated area status, for example, nature reserves). A series of structural equation analyses provided evidence for a bidirectional association between connectedness and restoration. Consideration of the psychological benefits associated with different types and quality of environment has implications for human health, environmental management, and conservation. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to test whether or not the load-bearing capacity of occlusal veneers bonded to enamel and made of ceramic or hybrid materials does differ from those of porcelain-fused-to-metal or lithium disilicate glass ceramic crowns. Material and methods: In 80 human molars occlusal enamel was removed without extending into the dentin in order to mimic substance defects caused by attrition. The restorations were digitally designed at a standardized thickness of either 0.5 mm or 1.0 mm. For each thickness, 4 test groups were formed each including a different restorative material: “0.5-ZIR”: 0.5 mm thick zirconia (Vita YZ HT); “1.0-ZIR”: 1.0 mm thick zirconia (Vita YZ HT); “0.5-LDC”: 0.5 mm thick lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press); “1.0-LDC”: 1.0 mm thick lithium disilicate ceramic (IPS e.max Press); “0.5-HYC”: 0.5 mm thick PICN (Vita Enamic); “1.0-HYC”: 1.0 mm thick PICN (Vita Enamic); “0.5-COC”: 0.5 mm thick tooth shaded resin composite (Lava Ultimate) and “1.0-COC”: 1.0 mm thick tooth shaded resin composite (Lava ultimate). Each group consists of 10 specimens. Two additional groups of 10 specimens each were used as controls and exhibited conventional crown preparations. In one group the crowns were made of lithium-disilicate ceramic (“CLD”: IPS e.max CAD) and the other group consisted of porcelain-fused to metal crowns (“PFM”). All restorations were cemented onto the prepared teeth following the manufacturer's instruction of the corresponding luting cement. Subsequently, they were thermo-mechanically aged and then loaded until fracture. Load-bearing capacities (Fmax) between the groups were compared applying the Kruskal-Wallis test (p &lt; 0.05) and pairwise group comparisons using the Dunn's method. Results: Median values (and quartiles) for the load-bearing capacity amounted to (Fmax) 2′407 (1′670; 2′490) N for the CLD group and to 2′033 (1′869; 2′445) N for the PFM group. For the 0.5 mm thick restorations Fmax reached the highest median value in group 0.5-HYC 2′390 (1′355; 2′490) N, followed by 0.5-COC 2′200 (1′217; 2′492) N and 0.5-LDC 1′692 (1′324; 2′355) N. No results were obtained for group 0.5-ZIR due to the impracticability to fabricate ultra-thin specimens. The distribution of the values for the 1.0 mm thick restorations was 2′489 (2′426; 2′491) N for 1.0-COC, 2′299 (2′156; 2′490) N for 1.0-ZIR, 2′124 (1′245; 2′491) N for 1.0-HYC, and 1′537 (1′245; 1′783) N for 1.0-LDC. The differences of the medians between the test and the control groups did not reach statistical significance for the 0.5 mm thick specimens (KW: p = 0.6952 and p = 0.6986). Within the groups exhibiting 1.0 mm thickness, however, significant different medians were found: 1.0-LDC &lt; 1.0-ZIR and 1.0-LDC &lt; 1.0-COC (KW: p &lt; 0.0209). Conclusions: Regarding their maximum load-bearing capacity, minimally invasive occlusal veneers made of ceramic and hybrid materials can be applied to correct occlusal tooth wear and thus replace conventional crown restorations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hot deformation behaviour of Mo-TZM alloy over a temperature range of 1400–1700 °C and strain rate range of 0.001–10.0 s−1 was investigated. The microstructure after deformation was characterized at each deformation condition using electron back scatter diffraction technique. The high strain rate sensitivity domain was found to be in the strain rate range of 10−2 - 10−3 s−1 and in temperature range of 1480–1650 °C. The flow stress behaviour of the material indicated dynamic recovery as well as recrystallization of the material during deformation. Microstructural investigation confirmed the occurrence of continuous dynamic recrystallization from 1400 to 1500 °C. At higher temperature (1600–1700 °C) and low strain rates (10−2 - 10−3 s−1) grain growth was dominant. At high strain rates (0.1–10 s−1) and high temperature (1600–1700 °C) dynamic recrystallization was not observed. Based on the experimental observations a schematic model of the microstructure evolution of TZM during deformation at high temperatures was proposed. © 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB  - Group-based sparse representation (GSR) models of natural images decompose each patch in group as a sparse linear combination from an over-complete dictionary and assume the sparse coefficients of each patch have a common set of nonzero support. Although the GSR models have shown great success in image restoration (IR) applications, however, current models are simple extension of traditional L0 or L1 sparse models and lack spatial adaption and principled fashion. In this paper, we propose a novel GSR model calling simultaneous sparse Bayesian coding (SSBC) model. In this model, the shared scaling variables in patch group are first learned by the empirical Bayesian strategy. Based on the learned scaling variables, the sparse coefficients can be efficiently solved by the posterior means of the coefficients. We further generalize this model to process general IR tasks with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) techniques. Extensive experiments on image denoising, inpainting, deblurring and single image super-resolution demonstrate that the proposed method achieves notable objective and subjective improvements over many state-of-the-art restored methods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this randomized controlled prospective clinical trial was to evaluate the short time clinical behaviour of an altered resin modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC), which is claimed to possess bioactivity, in posterior restorations and to compare it intraindividually with a nanofilled resin composite. Methods: Totally 78 pairs Class II and 4 pairs Class I restorations were placed in 29 female and 38 male participants with a mean age of 58.3 years (range 37–86). Each patient received at random at least one pair of, as similar as possible, Class II or Class I restorations. In the first cavity of each pair, the modified flowable RMGIC (ACTIVA Bioactive; AB) was placed after phosphoric acid etching of the cavity and without adhesive, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In the other cavity a well established nanofilled resin composite (CeramX; RC) with a single step self-etch adhesive (Xeno Select) was placed. The restorations were evaluated using slightly modified USPHS criteria at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Caries risk and parafunctional habits of the participants were estimated. Results: 158 restorations, 8 Class I and 150 Class II, were evaluated at the one year recalls. At baseline two failed restorations were observed (2AB), at 6 months six failures (5AB, 1RC) and at 12 months another thirteen failed restorations were observed (12AB, 1RC). This resulted in annual failure rates of 24.1% for the AB and 2.5% for RC (p < 0.0001). The main reasons for failure for AB were lost restorations (5), postoperative symptoms (4) and secondary caries (3). Do to the unacceptable very high one-year failure frequency, the clinical study was stopped and no further evaluation will be performed. Significance: The use of the AB restorative in Class II cavities, applied as instructed by the manufacturer after a short phosphoric acid pretreatment but without adhesive system, resulted in a non-acceptable very high failure frequency after a one year period. Further studies should be conducted using a bonding agent © 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials

AB  - Approximately 15% of globally diagnosed breast cancers are designated as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we investigated the effect of the natural compound, Bis(2- ethyl hexyl) 1H-pyrrole-3,4-dicarboxylate (TCCP), purified from Tinospora cordifolia on MDA-MB-231, a TNBC cell line. The pro-apoptotic nature of TCCP on MDA-MB-231 was determined by assessing various apoptotic markers. ROS generation, intracellular calcium, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), MPTP, cardiolipin peroxidation and caspase activity were determined fluorometrically. BAX, BCL-2, cytochrome c, caspases, and p53 protein expressions were determined by immunoblotting. Further, the effect of TCCP on DNA and cell death was determined by DNA fragmentation assay, annexin-V staining, and cell cycle analysis. TCCP treatment caused endogenous ROS generation, increase in intracellular calcium and phosphorylation of p53 in a concentration-dependent manner, which was reverted upon pre-treatment with pifithrin-μ. This led to the downstream altered expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, MPTP, and cardiolipin peroxidation. TCCP induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol, caspase activation, ultimately resulting in DNA fragmentation. Further, induction of apoptosis and morphological alterations were evident from the phosphatidylserine externalization and increase in sub G1 population. The in vivo Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) mouse study revealed the effectiveness of TCCP in reducing the tumor burden and resulted in a ~2 fold increase in mice survival with minimal hepato-renal toxicity. Overall, TCCP was shown to be efficient in inducing ROS and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by restoring p53 activity in MDA-MB-231 cells and also induced EAT cell death in vivo thereby inhibiting tumor proliferation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Restoration of mangrove forests through community involvement offers the promise of reaping multiple environmental dividends while simultaneously helping local communities augment their livelihoods through generating payments from ecosystem services. However, there exist several challenges to the success of such restoration projects. In this paper, one such key challenge, that of the risk of extreme climatic events, is considered. Optimal rate of mangrove restoration on public coastal lands is derived in the presence of a future risk of extreme cyclones decimating the mangrove forests. Using the context of the Sundarbans region of India, which has the largest mangrove forests on the planet, we develop a model of community led restoration efforts where local inhabitants receive credit for carbon sequestered in the process. Results indicate that when communities do not receive outside support through wages or reimbursement of plantation costs, restoration efforts get spread over a longer time horizon. Presence of a risk of future cyclone events that could destroy the restored forests prompts speedier restoration, which may not be an optimal outcome from the perspective of global carbon mitigation efforts. An optimal plan that is primarily concerned with deriving sequestration benefits from newly restored mangroves leads to lower restoration levels in the presence of higher cyclone risks. However, irrespective of the institutional setting under which restoration is incentivized, given the relatively stable nature of underground carbon stored in mangroves, it is optimal to undertake higher restoration efforts when climatic risks are low. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Underwater image restoration, which is the keystone to the underwater vision research, is still a challenging work. The key point of underwater image restoration work is how to remove the turbidity and the color distortion caused by the underwater environment. In this paper, we propose an underwater image restoration method based on transferring an underwater style image into a recovered style using Multi-Scale Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (MCycle GAN) System. We include a Structural Similarity Index Measure loss (SSIM loss), which can provide more flexibility to model the detail structural to improve the image restoration performance. We use dark channel prior (DCP) algorithm to get the transmission map of an image and design an adaptive SSIM loss to improve underwater image quality. We input this information into the network for multi-scale calculation on the images, which achieves the combination of DCP algorithm and Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN). By compared the quantitative and qualitative with existing state-of-the-art approaches, our method shows a pleasing performance on the underwater image dataset. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A Free-Ascending Tripod (FAT) was deployed at a water depth of 2100 m to measure the currents and sediment movement at the seafloor. FAT is used to better understand how and where deep-seafloor sediment moves and accumulates. We also use FATs to study deep-sea biology. In the images obtained by the camera, biological animals can hardly be distinguished. In this paper, we use image processing technology to uncover the real deep-sea scene. We propose four methods for improving the underwater image quality. First, we use the deep-sea optical imaging model to determine the properties of water in different sea areas and then remove the haze from underwater images using the underwater dual dark channel model. Next, we remove the footprint of artificial light through halo-estimation devignetting. Then, we obtain the real deep-sea scene color based on the color temperature of the camera and the inherent optical properties of water. Finally, we propose a semi-self-similarity-based super resolution for super-resolving the low-quality images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aims: Clinical trials have shown the beneficial effects of exercise training against pulmonary fibrosis. This study aimed to investigate whether prophylactic intervention with exercise training attenuates lung fibrosis via modulating endogenous hydrogen sulphde (H2S) generation. Methods: First, ICR mice were allocated to Control, Bleomycin, Exercise, and Bleomycin + Exercise groups. Treadmill exercise began on day 1 and continued for 4 weeks. A single intratracheal dose of bleomycin (3 mg/kg) was administered on day 15. Second, ICR mice were allocated to Control, Bleomycin, H2S, and Bleomycin + H2S groups. H2S donor NaHS (28 μmol/kg) was intraperitoneally injected once daily for 2 weeks. Results: Bleomycin-treated mice exhibited increased levels of collagen deposition, hydroxyproline, collagen I, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, Smad2/Smad3/low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP-6)/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation, and Smad4/β-catenin expression in lung tissues (P &lt; 0.01), which was alleviated by exercise training (P &lt; 0.01 except for Smad4 and phosphorylated GSK-3β: P &lt; 0.05). Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis was associated with increased α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and decreased E-cadherin expression (P &lt; 0.01). Double immunofluorescence staining showed the co-localization of E-cadherin/α-SMA, indicating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) formation, which was ameliorated by exercise training. Moreover, exercise training restored bleomycin-induced downregulation of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) expression, as well as H2S generation in lung tissue (P &lt; 0.01). NaHS treatment attenuated bleomycin-induced TGF-β1 production, activation of LRP-6/β-catenin signalling, EMT and lung fibrosis (P &lt; 0.01 except for β-catenin: P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Exercise training restores bleomycin-induced downregulation of pulmonary CBS/CSE expression, thus contributing to the increased H2S generation and suppression of TGF-β1/Smad and LRP-6/β-catenin signalling pathways, EMT and lung fibrosis. © 2018 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

AB  - Load restoration is an important issue for power system restoration after a blackout. A second order conic programming (SOCP) model is proposed based on the information gap decision theory (IGDT) to maximize load pickup considering the uncertainty of load increment. Because distribution functions of load increment are difficult to obtain, the optimization of load pickup is transformed to maximize the fluctuation range of load increment by the IGDT. The derived optimal fluctuation range can ensure that the reenergized system is secure, and the amount of load pickup is always better than the specified expectation. Moreover, because the optimization model of the fluctuation range is a mixed-integer nonlinear model which is challenging to solve accurately and efficiently, the nonlinear model is transformed into a SOCP model that can be efficiently solved using CPLEX. The efficiency of the IGDT-based SOCP model is validated using the New England (10-machine 39-bus) system. The simulation results show that the derived load pickup shows expected robustness with respect to the load increment uncertainty. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: In the present study, we investigated the fusion process between amorphous microparticles of the calcium salt of the physiological polymer comprising orthophosphate units, of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), and enamel. Methods: This polymer was incorporated as an ingredient into toothpaste and the fusion process was studied by electron microscopy and by synchrotron-based X-ray tomography microscopy (SRXTM) techniques. Results: The data showed that toothpaste, supplemented with the amorphous Ca-polyP microparticles (aCa-polyP-MP), not only reseals tooth defects on enamel, like carious lesions, and dentin, including exposed dentinal tubules, but also has the potential to induce re-mineralization in the enamel and dentin regions. The formation of a regeneration mineralic zone on the tooth surface induced by aCa-polyP-MP was enhanced upon exposure to artificial saliva, as demonstrated by SRXTM. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis revealed an increase in the calcium/phosphorus atomic ratio of the enamel deposits to values characteristic for the particles during the treatment with polyP applied in the toothpaste, indicating a fusion of the particles with the tooth mineral. Significance: Our results suggest that toothpaste enriched with aCa-polyP-MP is a promising biomimetic material for accelerating enamel and dentin restoration. © 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials

AB  - Restoration is difficult when topsoil and subsoil become mixed during pipeline construction. We studied soil properties, seedling emergence and establishment after pipeline construction in the Rio Grande Plains, Texas following physical (with or without erosion control blanket, ECB), chemical (humic substances, HS), and/or biological (native species mix) treatment. We documented higher soil water following precipitation under ECB; even with ECB soil water evaporated rapidly between rainfall events. Soil temperatures were cooler at mid-day under ECB on sunny days but similar on cool days and during evening. We observed from 3 to 8 more seedlings/0.09 m2 with ECB. Plots were dominated by exotic grasses after 2 years, likely because of seed bank and seed rain influences. The annual cover crop reduced exotic species biomass but did not negatively impact native species biomass. Pipeline construction affected all soil properties analyzed when compared to adjacent undisturbed areas; many soil properties changed on the pipeline following construction. Humic substances had no measurable effects. ECB enhanced seedling emergence but did not affect 2-year growing season biomass. Recommendations include proper seedbed preparation; ECB during periods of unfavorable conditions; use of locally-adapted species and an annual cover crop; and measures to preclude invasion of non-native species. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Joule heating can instantaneously achieve high temperatures (&gt;2000 °C) by applying electrical current on a resistive material. This ohmic heating by the passage of an electric current through a conducting domain may effectively heal the defective sites (i.e., vacancies, structural defects, and sp3 oxygen groups) of graphene oxide (GO) and revert them into sp2 domains. Indeed, the direction of electric field controls the texture of GO with preferential alignment, which significantly affects the transport properties along the fiber axis. Here we present electrical current-induced manipulation of resistive domain (i.e. Joule heating) as an effective healing method for the defect sites in GO fibers (GOFs). Systematic control of input current restores the sp2 lattice structures within fibers in a well-controlled manner. Structural evolution mechanism is proposed for multilayer stacked graphitic structures as well as graphene sheet plane under the reduction process. This defect-healing principle is rapid, environmentally benign and energy efficient, compared to other defect restoration methods, and yields tailored-aligned fibers with a high current-carrying capability and facile charge transport, which is potentially beneficial for power cables and other relevant applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper Weibull parametric proportional hazard model (PHM) is used to estimate the failure rate of every individual cable based on its age and a set of explanatory factors. The required information for the proposed method is obtained by exploiting available historical cable inventory and failure data. This data-driven method does not require any additional measurements on the cables, and allows the cables to be ranked for maintenance prioritization and repair actions. Furthermore, the results of reliability analysis of power cables are compared when the cables are considered as repairable or non-repairable components. The paper demonstrates that the methods which estimate the time-to-the-first failure (for non-repairable components) lead to incorrect conclusions about reliability of repairable power cables. The proposed method is used to evaluate the failure rate of each individual Paper Insulated Lead Cover (PILC) underground cables in a distribution grid in the south of Sweden. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, cochlear implants (CIs) have been provided in growing numbers to people with not only bilateral deafness but also to people with unilateral hearing loss, at times in order to alleviate tinnitus. This study presents audiological data from 15 adult participants (ages 48 ± 12 years) with single sided deafness. Results are presented from 9/15 adults, who received a CI (SSD-CI) in the deaf ear and were tested in Acoustic or Acoustic + CI hearing modes, and 6/15 adults who are planning to receive a CI, and were tested in the unilateral condition only. Testing included (1) audiometric measures of threshold, (2) speech understanding for CNC words and AzBIO sentences, (3) tinnitus handicap inventory, (4) sound localization with stationary sound sources, and (5) perceived auditory motion. Results showed that when listening to sentences in quiet, performance was excellent in the Acoustic and Acoustic + CI conditions. In noise, performance was similar between Acoustic and Acoustic + CI conditions in 4/6 participants tested, and slightly worse in the Acoustic + CI in 2/6 participants. In some cases, the CI provided reduced tinnitus handicap scores. When testing sound localization ability, the Acoustic + CI condition resulted in improved sound localization RMS error of 29.2° (SD: ±6.7°) compared to 56.6° (SD: ±16.5°) in the Acoustic-only condition. Preliminary results suggest that the perception of motion direction, whereby subjects are required to process and compare directional cues across multiple locations, is impaired when compared with that of normal hearing subjects. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The rise of restoration projects on large rivers is a response to the increasing human-induced pressures on these ecosystems. Despite this, there is a relative lack of data documenting restoration success using macroinvertebrate communities in such environments, with those existing frequently producing contrasting results. Here, we examined post-restoration responses of macroinvertebrates following a unique experimental restoration approach based on controlled bank erosion and artificial groyne implementation, initiated in 2013 on the Old Rhine River (France-Germany). We investigated how macroinvertebrate communities have responded to restoration-induced variations in three main abiotic parameters, i.e. water depth, flow velocity and substrate type, by comparing the restored section with unrestored ones. The Eco-hydro-morphological index (EHMID), a modified version of a hydro-morphological diversity index, showed a gain in mesohabitat heterogeneity along the whole site. Newly created mesohabitats with low flow velocity and finer substrate were dissimilar to those along the rest of the Old Rhine channel, favouring burrowing taxa such as Odonata. The presence of such insect larvae was related to the post-restoration emergence of typical alluvial terrestrial-aquatic border connectivity, and the rise in macrophytes over time. On the whole site, changes in composition or in functional profile diversity were highly related to the high degree of mesohabitat heterogeneity from the restored section, which would persist as long as groynes remain. The main inter-annual effect concerned the decrease in invasive taxa abundance that also varied according to any changes in fluvial forms. Our findings confirmed that macroinvertebrate responses are highly influenced by hydrological events and are dependent on the study-scale monitoring, clearly putting forward fine-scale hydromorphological gradients. Biological results from this restoration project should approach those obtained in smaller rivers restored using deflectors, suggesting a potential application of the hydraulic law of similarities. However, the accuracy of biological prediction using said application is limited by the distance from source populations, biological invasions and internal river dynamics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Total Variation (TV) is an effective and popular prior model in the field of regularization-based image processing. This paper focuses on total variation for removing impulse noise in image restoration. This type of noise frequently arises in data acquisition and transmission due to many reasons, e.g., a faulty sensor or analog-to-digital converter errors. Removing this noise is an important task in image restoration. State-of-the-art methods such as Adaptive Outlier Pursuit(AOP) [1] , which is based on TV with norm data fidelity, only give sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new sparse optimization method, called PADMM, which solves the TV-based restoration problem with norm data fidelity. To effectively deal with the resulting non-convex non-smooth optimization problem, we first reformulate it as an equivalent biconvex Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), and then solve it using a proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PADMM). Our 0TV-PADMM method finds a desirable solution to the original norm optimization problem and is proven to be convergent under mild conditions. We apply PADMM to the problems of image denoising and deblurring in the presence of impulse noise. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PADMM outperforms state-of-the-art image restoration methods. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Historic musical instruments, especially violins, have witnessed centuries of stories and events, passing from hand to hand among musicians, collectors and restorers. Historical last wills and trading documents makes it possible to reconstruct the movements around the world of the decorated ex-San Lorenzo violin and its story throughout its owners. The history of this precious violin began in 1718 in the Cremonese workshop of Antonio Stradivari. It represents a mature example of the Master's “Golden Age” period (1700 to 1720) and is unique for an unusual inscription “GLORIA ET DIVITIAE IN DOMO EIUS” which adorns its center-bout ribs. Numerous imaging techniques (stereomicroscopy, optical microscopy, VIS and UV photography, X-ray radiography, XRF mapping), spectroscopic (FORS, FTIR in reflectance mode, XRF, SEM-EDX) and chromatographic (Pyrolysis SolidPhase Microextraction Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometry) were applied in order to: (i) give new data related to both original and restoration materials, (ii) make considerations about the restoration procedures adopted over the centuries, and (iii) highlight the main issues of historic musical instrument preservation. The material information gathered from this multi-technique study is varied depending on the areas under investigation. This analytical campaign, which is the widest ever made on a single musical instrument, gives a new overview of the materials applied on historic bowed musical instruments and opens debate about what should be preserved and how to do it. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conservation biology and restoration ecology have historically focused on promoting biodiversity and safeguarding endangered species. However, the ecosystem services (ES) concept has given these fields a new, anthropocentric rationale: promoting human wellbeing. Here we investigate how the ES concept has penetrated decision making and public support for ecological restoration in Australia, by examining the national government's funding priorities, land managers’ project goals, and the public's willingness to pay for restoration. We find that national funding priorities and local project implementation have thoroughly mainstreamed the ES concept, and that the public is generally supportive of ES goals. More than half of projects awarded funding, and two-thirds of land managers’ implemented projects, had explicit ES goals. Among managers who participated in semi-structured interviews, 45% rated ES aims as at least as important as biodiversity aims in their projects. The public was more willing to donate to a restoration scenario that included ES than one that did not, and 41% of the public chose an ES as the preferred outcome of restoration. Across all groups, provisioning services were the least preferred ES outcome, compared to regulating or cultural services. Our results indicate that ES are now important rationales for restoration funding and implementation. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - In recent years, approaches based on nonlocal self-similarity and global structure regularization have led to significant improvements in image restoration. Nonlocal self-similarity exploits the repetitiveness of small image patches as a powerful prior in the reconstruction process. Likewise, global structure regularization is based on the principle that the structure of objects in the image is represented by a relatively small portion of pixels. Enforcing this structural information to be sparse can thus reduce the occurrence of reconstruction artifacts. So far, most image restoration approaches have considered one of these two strategies, but not both. This paper presents a novel image restoration method that combines nonlocal self-similarity and global structure sparsity in a single efficient model. Group of similar patches are reconstructed simultaneously, via an adaptive regularization technique based on the weighted nuclear norm. Moreover, global structure is preserved using an innovative strategy, which decomposes the image into a smooth component and a sparse residual, the latter regularized using ℓ1 norm. An optimization technique, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm, is used to recover corrupted images efficiently. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two important image restoration tasks: image completion and super-resolution. Experimental results show our method to outperform state-of-the-art approaches for these tasks, for various types and levels of image corruption. © 1992-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of the study was to characterize the microstructure, constituents, and mechanical properties of mono and bilayered zirconia specimens infiltrated with silica by the sol gel method. Methods: 180 zirconia discs (14-mm diameter) were divided in 3 groups (n = 60) according to thickness (1.2, 0.5 mm) and further divided in two groups (n = 30) according to treatment (infiltrated or not). Disk thickness was 1.2 mm for the control samples. Veneering feldspathic porcelain had two thicknesses (0.5 mm and 1 mm) at the tops of the zirconia discs. All groups were subjected to the biaxial flexural test in an aqueous medium. Weibull analysis was performed for determination of the Weibull modulus (m) and characteristic strength (σ0). The specimens were characterized by SEM and EDS and XRD. Hardness and elastic modulus were measured by nano-indentation and pulse-echo methods, respectively. Fracture toughness was determined by the nano-indentation technique. A scratch test was used for evaluation of the adhesion between the zirconia and porcelain. Results: There was less variability (higher Weibull modulus) in the infiltrated monolithic specimens; biaxial flexural strength was not statistically higher in the veneered infiltrated specimens and was decreased for the 1-mm veneered infiltrated group. The diffractograms showed formation of ZrSiO4 crystal phase. Hardness also increased in the infiltrated monolithic zirconia, whereas fracture toughness decreased. Adhesion between zirconia and porcelain was superior in the non-infiltrated monolithic specimens. Conclusions: Infiltration increased the structural homogeneity and hardness of the monolithic zirconia, but it reduced fracture toughness, and the adhesion to porcelain. Clinical significance: Within the limitations of the present study, it is possible to recommend the infiltration of silica gel in zirconia only for monolithic restorations. © 2018

AB  - Coastal regions and deltas around the globe are seeking financing for resilience projects to cope with more frequent extreme events, sea-level rise and land subsidence. Interest is growing in natural infrastructure that generates multiple ecosystem services including flood risk reduction. The growth of the conservation finance market represents an opportunity to support these investments, but there is a need for pilot transactions that align incentives across private and public entities, along with rigorous performance metrics for natural infrastructure linked to resilience outcomes. We test the feasibility of the Environmental Impact Bond (EIB) model to address these challenges. An EIB is a form of Pay-for-Performance debt financing where investors provide upfront capital to implement a project and are repaid according to the degree to which desired environmental outcomes are achieved. We evaluate this concept for wetland restoration projects identified in Louisiana's Coastal Master Plan by developing a site selection procedure and designing a multi-stakeholder transaction tied to restoration outcomes. Based on our proposed model we conclude that an EIB could be used to accelerate restoration and increase the net benefits of wetland investments, aligning incentives of the investors and payors around metrics of wetland sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mowing is a common management technique employed in Europe and North America to manage seral wetland plant communities to: (a) prevent development to late succession, (b) minimise internal eutrophication and (c) conserve biodiversity. However, little is known about the effect mowing has on water quality, and the duration of any effects. Therefore, mowing treatments were applied in two abandoned fen plant communities: a Schoenus nigricans-Juncus subnodulosus (SN) community (hand-cutting) and a Cladio-Molinietum (CM) community (machine mowing). Mowing took place once in each community across three sites in North Wales, U.K. Effects on water chemistry were followed for two years post mowing. © 2017

AB  - In the vicinity of the QCD phase boundary, the thermodynamic pressure receives contributions from a regular component Pr and a non-analytic component Ps. Pr describes the bulk properties of the QCD thermodynamics, whereas Ps carries information on chiral criticality. We discuss the computation of Pr in the hadronic phase within the S-matrix formulation of statistical mechanics, and the determination of Ps using high-order cumulants of net baryon number fluctuations. We show that the S-matrix approach provides a consistent description to both the lattice QCD results on the baryon electric charge correlation and on the proton production yield in heavy ion collisions at the LHC. In addition, it is suggested that chiral criticality is reflected in the energy dependence of certain ratios of net baryon number fluctuations. © 2018

AB  - This study investigates the effects of pre-acidification (pH 6.7–5.4) of skim milk, followed by pH-restoration of the retentates, on spray-drying performance, physico-chemical properties and functionality of the resulting milk protein concentrate (MPC). Powder recovery decreased with decreasing pH of pre-acidification but improved with pH-restoration. Colloidal calcium was gradually solubilized with decreasing pH of pre-acidification but was slightly recovered by pH-restoration. Dissociation of micellar caseins increased with decreasing pH of pre-acidification of skim milk and was further increased by pH-restoration. Casein micelles maintained their overall structures at pre-acidification pH of 6.7–6.0, and partially disintegrated into loosely entangled aggregates at pH 5.7–5.4; while after pH-restoration, micelles generally maintained their overall structures at pre-acidification pH of 6.0, and completely disintegrated at pH 5.7–5.4. Solubility and emulsifying properties of MPC improved with decreasing pH of pre-acidification and with pH-restoration. Heat stability of MPC declined with decreasing pH of pre-acidification but improved with pH-restoration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this ex-vivo study was to evaluate the impact of cavity size and glass-fiber post (GFP) placement on the load capability of endodontically treated maxillary incisors directly restored with resin composite. Materials and methods: Ninety-six extracted human maxillary central incisors were endodontically treated and distributed to four groups (n = 24): access cavity (A), access cavity and uni-proximal class III cavity (U), access cavity and bi-proximal class III cavity (B), and decoronated tooth (D). Specimens were restored with resin composite, and 12 specimen of each group received an adhesively placed glass-fiber post (P). Prior to linear loading, specimens were exposed to thermo-mechanical loading (TCML). Statistical analysis was performed using log-rank test after TCML, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test to compare load capabilities (Fmax). Results: Significantly more failures occurred in group D for specimens without GFP during TCML (p = 0.001). Fmax (mean (SD) in N was (A) 513 (124), (AP) 554 (201), (U) 438 (171), (UP) 537 (232) (B) 483 (219), (BP) 536 (281), D 143 (181), and DP 500 (331), and differed significantly among groups (p = 0.003). Pair-wise comparison revealed lower Fmax values for group D compared to all other groups (p &lt; 0.034) except group DP. Conclusions: Endodontically treated maxillary central incisors with cavity sizes up to bi-proximal class III may be successfully directly restored with resin composite. Post placement shows no additional effect except for decoronated endodontically treated incisors. Clinical relevance: Endodontically treated incisors with access cavities to class III cavities can be successfully restored with resin composite. Post placement for decoronated ETT is recommended. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the clinical performance of bulk-fill resin composites with conventional resin composites used for direct restorations of posterior teeth. Methods: This review followed the PRISMA statement. This review was registered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42016053436). A search of the scientific literature was performed by two independent reviewers using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from commencement until January 2018. The research question was “Do bulk-fill resin composites have a clinical performance comparable to conventional resin composites in posterior restorations?” Only studies evaluating class I and II direct restorations in permanent teeth with a follow-up period of at least 1 year were included. The RevMan 5 program was used for meta-analysis, calculating the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the dichotomous outcome (restoration failure or success). Results: Ten articles were selected, comprising 941 analyzed restorations. The mean follow-up period was 33.6 months (12–72 months). No statistically significant differences in the failure rate were observed between conventional and base/flowable bulk-fill resin composites (p = 0.31; RR 1.49; 95% CI 0.69–3.25) or full-body/sculptable bulk-fill resin composites (p = 0.12; RR 1.89; 95% CI 0.84–4.24). Conclusions: The present systematic review and meta-analysis indicate similar clinical performances of bulk-fill and conventional resin composites over a follow-up period of 12 to 72 months. Clinical significance: Based on the results of this study, the bulk-fill resin composites could be an alternative for direct restorations in posterior teeth. However, clinical trials of longer duration are required. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aiming to comprehend the relationship among restoration techniques and soil attributes, we compared the soil attributes of four forest stands: three regarding an experiment initiated eight years ago with distinct techniques: perch, abandonment and transposition, and one that was pristine forest used as a reference. In each local, five soil samples were taken at 0–20 cm, and another sample was taken in a profile (layers: 20–40, 40–60 and 60–80 cm) for analysis of the major physical, chemical and isotopic attributes. The soil density varied from 1.20 to 1.24 g.cm−3. The different values of chemical attributes among the treatments and reference revealed that the yet the areas are no longer degraded, they cannot be considered restored (reasons explained in the text). Evaluating the characteristics of the soils and making specific silvicultural and soil-related practices before implementing the intervention, is a prerequisite that should be considered by managers in restoration projects. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Image restoration is one of the fundamental and essential tasks within image processing. In medical imaging, developing an effective algorithm that can automatically remove random noise in brain magnetic resonance (MR) images is challenging. The collateral filter has been shown a more powerful algorithm than many existing methods. However, the computation of the collateral filter is more time-consuming and the selection of the filter parameters is also laborious. This paper proposes an automatic noise removal system based on the accelerated collateral filter for brain MR images. Methods: To solve these problems, we first accelerated the collateral filter with parallel computing using the graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture. We adopted the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), an application programming interface for the GPU by NVIDIA, to hasten the computation. Subsequently, the optimal filter parameters were selected and the automation was achieved by artificial neural networks. Specifically, an artificial neural network system associated with image feature analysis was adopted to establish the automatic image restoration framework. The best feature combination was selected by the paired t-test and the sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) methods. Results: Experimental results indicated that not only did the proposed automatic image restoration algorithm perform dramatically faster than the traditional collateral filter, but it also effectively removed the noise in a wide variety of brain MR images. A speed up gain of 34 was attained to process an MR image, which completed within 0.1 s. Representative illustrations of brain tumor images demonstrated the capability of identifying lesion boundaries, which outperformed many existing methods. Conclusions: We believe that our accelerated and automated restoration framework is promising for achieving robust filtering in many brain MR image restoration applications. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Rohrschollen Island is an artificial island of the large Upper Rhine river whose geometry and hydrological dynamics are the result of engineering works during the 19th and 20th centuries. Before its channelization, the Rhine river was characterized by an intense hydromorphological activity which maintained a high level of biodiversity along the fluvial corridor. This functionality considerably decreased during the two last centuries. In 2012, a restoration project was launched to reactivate typical alluvial processes, including bedload transport, lateral channel dynamics, and surface-subsurface water exchanges. An integrated hydrological model has been applied to the area of Rohrschollen Island to assess the efficiency of the restoration regarding surface and subsurface flows. This model is calibrated using measured piezometric heads. Simulated patterns of water exchanges between the surface and subsurface compartments of the island are checked against the information derived from thermal infrared (TIR) imaging. The simulated results are then used to better understand the evolutions of the infiltration-exfiltration zones over time and space and to determine the physical controls of surface-subsurface interactions on the hydrographic network of Rohrschollen Island. The use of integrated hydrological modeling has proven to be an efficient approach to assess the efficiency of restoration actions regarding surface and subsurface flows. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Fish harbor a high diversity of parasites that play an important role for the ecosystem. Because these parasites have different life-cycle traits, changes in their populations or communities may provide useful information related to ecosystem health. Highly stressful conditions may reduce parasite communities or populations. However, it is not a rule since host-parasite interactions are hardly predictable. In this study, macroparasites of the fish sailfin molly (Poecilia velifera) from three sites (conserved, degraded and under restoration) located within a mangrove wetland area, in the Terminos Lagoon (southern Gulf of Mexico), were analyzed in order to determine their potential use as bioindicators. A total of 198 fish were examined for parasites. Six parasite species were found: two crustaceans (Argulus sp. and Ergasilus aff. cerastes), one trematode (Centrocestus formosanus), one monogenean (Gyrodactylus sp.) and two nematodes (Contracaecum sp. and Cuculanus sp.). There were no significant differences in the structure of parasite infracommunities as well as in prevalence and intensity of parasite populations between degraded and conserved sites. However, the site under restoration had poorer infracommunities and smaller populations of crustaceans and trematodes, which suggests that restoration efforts have not improved the ecological conditions. Based on these results, it is conjectured that parasites of P. velifera did not show useful information to provide a diagnosis related to ecosystem health. Beyond this ecological subject, the present study represents new host record for most parasite species found. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Many networks are physically or logically interdependent with each other, such as smart power grid, city traffic network and communication systems, where cascading overload failure becomes a major threat. Based on a load-dependent cascading model, we investigate the restoration characteristics in the consideration of repair resource, timing and load tolerance, for different coupling strength and network topologies in interdependent networks. We find that the restoration on the network with different coupling strength may lead to two extreme system effects with early repair: full recovery or completely collapse. Furthermore, SF–SF network is sensitive to repair resources, while repair effect of ER–ER network increases sharply when load tolerance is increased. When overloads are triggered in an ER network coupled with a SF network, the restoration effect can be obviously worse than other topology combinations. Our findings may help to design restoration strategy for interdependent networks and improve the system resilience. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - No in-depth studies covering litter decomposition were previously conducted on afforested postmining sites despite the importance of litter decomposition on soil formation, especially in degraded areas. We aimed to compare leaf litter decomposition rates of 14 tree species growing in mixed stands on a postmining spoil heap, and to compare their decay rates with those obtained in pure stands of tree species that are very often planted in postmining areas. The study was conducted on the Bełchatów Lignite Mine spoil heap, central Poland. We studied litter decomposition rates over 5 years using the litterbag method. Leaf litter decomposition rates (k constants; yr−1) after 5 years of the experiment were arranged from highest to lowest as follows: Prunus serotina (1.04), Alnus glutinosa (0.86), Fraxinus excelsior (0.81), Ulmus laevis (0.73), Acer pseudoplatanus (0.68), Populus tremula (0.63), Populus × canadensis (0.59), Betula pendula (0.54), Populus nigra ‘Italica’ (0.38), Quercus rubra (0.36), Pinus sylvestris (0.34), Robinia pseudoacacia (0.34), Fagus sylvatica (0.25), and Quercus robur (0.22). Decomposition rates increased with Mg, Ca, and summed Mg + Ca + P + K contents in freshly fallen leaves (%). All species-specific decomposition rates were higher in mixed than in Scots pine stands. Half of them were also higher than in pure stands of other tree species. Our results indicate that tree species composition could significantly affect the physiochemical properties of upper soil horizons on reclaimed areas. Based on these findings, we recommend planting high share of not only A. pseudoplatanus, A. glutinosa, and U. laevis but also F. sylvatica and Q. robur in stands on postmining spoil heaps, because mixed stands can accelerate soil development more than pure stands. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Pure copper and Cu-Zn plates were friction stir welded under the same condition to evaluate the effect of stacking fault energy on the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of the joints. For this aim, microstructure and texture of the joints were systematically characterized by electron backscattered diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, to study the mechanical properties of the different microstructural zones of the joints, nanoindentation tests were employed. The results showed that in pure copper, continuous dynamic recrystallization was the only restoration mechanism for the formation of new grains. By adding zinc into copper, namely decreasing stacking fault energy, both continuous and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization mechanisms occurred. To this end, the effect of stacking fault energy on the restoration mechanisms has been summarized by schematic models. Moreover, the effect of the restoration mechanisms on the yield strength and strain hardening behavior of the joints has been scrutinized. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Quaking or trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is a foundational tree species, which is native, common, and broadly distributed in North America. The ecology of aspen has been extensively studied throughout its range, but both research and forest management practices have focused primarily on its ability to regenerate asexually via root suckering. The seed-based reproductive ecology of aspen has received comparatively little attention, and information on the underlying processes, mechanisms, and requirements of seed regeneration tends to be scattered, somewhat anecdotal, or based only on localized research efforts. Here we review and explore some of the variables that influence the sexual reproduction and early establishment of aspen. We focus this review on western North America, where trembling aspen plays a dominant ecological role and may be disproportionately impacted by climate change. This synthesis presents existing information and identifies critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of seed –based aspen regeneration, in particular as it relates to flowering and seed production, as well as germination, first year growth, and survival of aspen seedlings. This information is discussed further in the context of aspen ecology and its application in both passive and active management approaches to aspen seedling regeneration and restoration. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) accumulation enhances carbon (C) sequestration and subsequently the restoration of degraded ecosystems, but the changes in soil N properties after vegetation restoration in such ecosystems are poorly understood. We collected data from 358 fixed points in the karst catchment in China to determine the trends, magnitude, and mechanisms of soil N sequestration after 10 years of revegetation. The revegetation types were tillage fields that were abandoned or were converted to pasture, planted forest, or converted to mixed pasture and forest and pasture lands that were abandoned (P_Aban) or converted to mixed pasture and forest (P_Mix). The changes in soil N density (g m−2) over time were insignificant, and only P_Aban, P_ Mix, and the overall catchment experienced significant increases in soil N concentration (g kg−1). Structural equation modeling indicated that bedrock exposure affected the change in soil N concentration (∆NC) and the soil N sequestration value (∆ND) via affecting the change in soil C concentration, by directly affecting bulk density, soil depth, and Ca2+. The soil C:N ratio increased significantly, and the increase in soil N was slower than that of C, suggesting a decoupling of soil C and N accumulation in the initial stage of revegetation. ∆ND was significantly related to the change in soil C:N ratio, indicating that the coupling between soil C and N may be constrained by insufficient soil N sequestration during revegetation. These findings suggest that the restoration of degraded karst ecosystems requires an increase in soil N input early during vegetation restoration. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We consider a class of non-Lipschitz regularization problems that include the TV p model as a special case. A lower bound theory of the non-Lipschitz regularization is obtained, which inspires us to propose an algorithm guaranteeing the non-expansiveness of the images gradient support set. After being proximally linearized, this algorithm can be easily implemented. Some standard techniques in image processing, like the fast Fourier transform, could be utilized. The global convergence is also established. Moreover, we prove that the restorations by the algorithm have edge preservation property. Numerical examples are given to show good performance of the algorithm and the rationality of the theories. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The Mkoji sub-catchment is the most populated sub-catchment in the uppermost part of the Rufiji basin in Tanzania, with critical users downstream, and it is vulnerable to water shortages. Despite the efforts made by governmental and non-governmental organizations in forming and supporting water user associations, little is known about their role on water resource management in the country. This study aimed to investigate the role of water user associations on the restoration of decreased environmental flow and degraded aquatic ecosystems in Tanzania, taking the Mkoji sub-catchment as a case study. Six water user associations were assessed, focusing on their strategies and influence on restoration, land use, ecosystem degradation, and their role in climate change mitigation strategies. Data were collected from various sources using interviews, focus group discussions and questionnaires. The Spearman correlation test was used to seek the relationship between the flow and the aquatic ecosystem. Statistical results showed that there was no correlation between the flow and rainfall, and there was a correlation between freshwater ecosystems and the flow. The results showed that 89% of the sample population accepted the decrease of the flow while 75% accepted the decrease of the fish catch in the freshwater ecosystem of the study. Based on the results obtained, the paper concluded that water user associations are doing a great job in management and restoration while politics, funding, and water permits were the main obstacles. Therefore, the government should play a role in restoring the ecosystem, bridging the gaps between farmers and animal keepers, land use planning, and developing aquaculture. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Soil microbial metabolism is vital for nutrient cycling and aboveground ecosystem stability. A general understanding of microbial metabolism and nutrient limitation under human disturbance in arid and semi-arid regions, which are the largest and most fragile oligotrophic ecosystems globally, however, is still limited. We quantified and compared the characteristics of nutrient limitation of soil microbes under natural/artificial grassland and shrubland, an ecological forest, an economic forest, and sloped cropland in typical arid and semi-arid ecosystems on the Loess Plateau, China. Vegetation restoration significantly affected the activities of extracellular enzymes and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry mainly by affecting soil nutrients and nutrient stoichiometry. A vector analysis of enzyme activity indicated that microbial communities were co-limited by carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) in all types of vegetation restoration. Linear regression indicated that microbial C and P limitations were significantly correlated with the stoichiometry of soil nutrient, suggesting that the balance of nutrient stoichiometry is an important factor maintaining microbial metabolism and elemental homeostasis. C and P limitations in the microbial communities were the lowest in the natural grassland. This implies that both vegetation and microbial communities under the restoration pattern of natural grassland were more stable under environmental stress, so the restoration of natural grassland should be recommended as the preferred option for ecosystem restoration in these arid and semi-arid regions. © 2018

It involves techniques that use plants as living building materials, for: (i) natural hazard control (e.g., soil erosion, torrential floods and landslides) and (ii) ecological restoration or nature-based re-introduction of species on degraded lands, river embankments, and disturbed environments. For a bioengineering project to be successful, engineers are required to highlight all the potential benefits and ecosystem services by documenting the technical, ecological, economic and social values. The novel approaches used by bioengineers raise questions for researchers and necessitate innovation from practitioners to design bioengineering concepts and techniques. Our objective in this paper, therefore, is to highlight the practice and research needs in soil and water bioengineering for reconciling natural hazard control and ecological restoration. Firstly, we review the definition and development of bioengineering technology, while stressing issues concerning the design, implementation, and monitoring of bioengineering actions. Secondly, we highlight the need to reconcile natural hazard control and ecological restoration by posing novel practice and research questions. © 2018

AB  - Enhancement and conservation of biodiversity in recovering communities is one of the primary goals of forest ecology and restoration. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying community assembly during restoration, we examined changes in taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity in four types of subtropical forests, consisting of a Eucalyptus plantation (EE), an Acacia mangium plantation (AM), a mixed native species plantation (NS), and a mixed coniferous plantation (MC), over 30 years of restoration (1985–2015). Temporal variation in taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity patterns were found to differ among the four plantation types, although their taxonomic diversity (species richness) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) increased monotonically as succession proceeded. Community dissimilarity decreased nonlinearly over the 30 years, and species composition within each plantation tended to stabilize at around 20 years. Overall, the phylogenetic structure of each plantation was random during the succession period. Taxonomic and phylogenetic rates did not vary markedly along the 30 years of restoration, but the taxonomic turnover rate of MC increased significantly while the phylogenetic turnover rate of NC augmented remarkably. These results indicated that deterministic processes played a more important role in determining the temporal dynamics of community composition while stochastic processes were more important for phylogenetic structure. Our findings further inform the development and design of appropriate restoration strategies, and provide insights into understanding the mechanisms regulating community assembly during the process of forest restoration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bisphosphonates (BPs) used for treating skeletal diseases can induce bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). Despite much effort, effective remedies are yet to be established. In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) extracted from salmon sperm for the treatment of BRONJ, in a BRONJ-induced rat model. Compared with BRONJ-induced samples, PDRN-treated samples exhibited lower necrotic bone percentages and increased numbers of blood vessels and attached osteoclast production. Moreover, local administration of PDRN at a high concentration (8 mg/kg) remarkably resolved the osteonecrosis. Findings from this study suggest that local administration of PDRN at a specific concentration may be considered clinically for the management of BRONJ. © 2019 by the authors

AB  - A methodology aiming to predict the vulnerability of masonry structures under seismic action is presented herein. Masonry structures, among which many are cultural heritage assets, present high vulnerability under earthquake. Reliable simulations of their response to seismic stresses are exceedingly difficult because of the complexity of the structural system and the anisotropic and brittle behavior of the masonry materials. Furthermore, the majority of the parameters involved in the problem such as the masonry material mechanical characteristics and earthquake loading characteristics have a stochastic-probabilistic nature. Within this framework, a detailed analytical methodological approach for assessing the seismic vulnerability of masonry historical and monumental structures is presented, taking into account the probabilistic nature of the input parameters by means of analytically determining fragility curves. The emerged methodology is presented in detail through application on theoretical and built cultural heritage real masonry structures. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Northern wetlands with organic soil i.e., mires are significant carbon storages. This key ecosystem service may be threatened by anthropogenic activities and climate change, yet we still lack a consensus on how these major changes affects their carbon sink capacities. We studied how forestry drainage and restoration combined with experimental warming, impacts greenhouse gas fluxes of wetlands with peat. We measured CO2 and CH4 during two and N2O fluxes during one growing season using the chamber method. Gas fluxes were primarily controlled by water table, leaf area and temperature. Land use had a clear impact of on CO2 exchange. Forestry drainage increased respiration rates and decreased field layer net ecosystem CO2 uptake (NEE) and leaf area index (LAI), while at restoration sites the flux rates and LAI had recovered to the level of undrained sites. CH4 emissions were exceptionally low at all sites during our study years due to natural drought, but still somewhat lower at drained compared to undrained sites. Moderate warming triggered an increase in LAI across all land use types. This was accompanied by an increase in cumulative seasonal NEE. Restoration appeared to be an effective tool to return the ecosystem functions of these wetlands as we found no differences in LAI or any gas flux components (PMAX, Reco, NEE, CH4 or N2O) between restored and undrained sites. We did not find any signs that moderate warming would compromise the return of the ecosystem functions related to C sequestration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - These main goals of the restoration in distribution networks are to reenergise loads in the area where the power outage occurs. In this study, a new multi-stage restoration process by the aid of the decision-making tree algorithm is proposed to maximise the restored loads and also to minimise switching operations in the distribution networks with distributed generations (DGs). This method includes three stages of initial restoration, reconfiguration and optimal load shedding. In order to reduce the search space, the network switches are categorised into different sets which avoid moving to any inappropriate result space. The simulations are carried out on the 69-bus distribution system and the results show the high capability and accuracy of the proposed method in the restoration of distribution networks. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the factors associated with non-closure of protective ileostomy after anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectum excision for rectal cancer, the morbidity associated with the closure of ileostomies and the rate of permanent ileostomy in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: we conducted a retrospective study with 174 consecutive patients diagnosed with rectal tumors, of whom 92 underwent anterior resection of the rectum with coloanal or colorectal anastomosis and protective ileostomy, with curative intent. We carried out a multivariate analysis to determine the factors associated with definite permanence of the stoma, as well as studied the morbidity of patients who underwent bowel continuity restoration. RESULTS: In the 84-month follow-up period, 54 of the 92 patients evaluated (58.7%) had the ileostomy closed and 38 (41.3%) remained with the stoma. Among the 62 patients who had the ileostomy closed, 11 (17.7%) presented some type of postoperative complication: three had ileal anastomosis dehiscence, five had intestinal obstruction, two had surgical wound infection, and one, pneumonia. Eight of these patients required a new stoma. CONCLUSION: according to the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with stoma permanence were anastomotic fistula, presence of metastases and closure of the ileostomy during chemotherapy.

MÉTODOS: estudo retrospectivo de 174 pacientes consecutivos com diagnóstico de tumores retais, dos quais 92 foram submetidos à ressecção anterior do reto com intenção curativa, anastomose coloanal ou colorretal e ileostomia de proteção. Foi realizada análise multivariada visando a determinar os fatores associados à permanência definitiva da estomia, assim como o estudo da morbidade nos que se submeteram à reconstrução do trânsito. RESULTADOS: no período de seguimento de 84 meses, 54 dos 92 pacientes avaliados (58,7%) tiveram a ileostomia fechada e 38 (41,3%) permaneceram com a estomia. Entre os 62 pacientes que tiveram a ileostomia fechada, 11 (17,7%) apresentaram algum tipo de complicação pós-operatória: três com deiscência de anastomose ileal, cinco com obstrução intestinal, dois com infecção de ferida operatória e um com pneumonia. Oito destes pacientes necessitaram de um novo estoma. CONCLUSÃO: de acordo com a análise multivariada, os fatores associados à permanência da estomia foram fístula de anastomose, presença de metástases e fechamento da ileostomia durante quimioterapia.

AB  - Tree planting and natural regeneration are the main approaches to achieve global forest restoration targets, affecting multiple hydrological processes, such as infiltration of rainfall. Our understanding of the effect of land use history and vegetation on the recovery of water infiltration and soil attributes in both restoration strategies is limited. Therefore, we investigated the recovery of top-soil saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil physical and hydraulic properties in five land use types: (i) a secondary old-growth forest; (ii) a forest established through assisted passive restoration 11 years ago; (iii) an actively restored forest, with a more intensive land use history and 11 years of age; (iv) a pasture with low-intensity use; and (v) a pasture with high-intensity use, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For these land use types, we determined the historical land use patterns and conducted soil sampling, using the Beerkan method to determine Ks values in the field. We also measured tree basal area, canopy cover, vegetation height, tree density and species richness in forest covers. The Ks decreased when land use was more intense prior to forest restoration actions. Our results indicate that land use legacy is a crucial factor to explain the current difference in soil and vegetation attributes among study sites. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This paper concerns wind effect on bottom shear stress (BSS), resuspension and redeposition of bottom sediments in the nearshore areas of the Etang de Berre (EB), a semi-enclosed lagoon, in the context of Zostera noltei (Z.n.) restoration. As in our previous paper, the first step is to compare BSS with its threshold, BSScr, for a wind speed of 21 m/s. But, here, a new simulation is performed for 16 wind directions regularly spaced. It permits to analyze the combined effect, over one year, of these winds on the erosion risk. For that, a mean value of |BSS|, i.e., a weighted average based on the frequency of each wind directions, has been determined and compared to BSScr for a class of roughness parameters. A similar averaging of BSS→ has been also evaluated to obtain the direction of an average bottom current. Then, the most important contribution of the present paper concerns the modelling of the wind-induced sediment erosion, transport and redeposition. The specific module SEDIM/MARS3D is used to determine how the thickness of a given mud-sand sedimentary layer can be changed by the wind-induced current during typical periods of 3 days of constant wind. This numerical study is performed for three wind speeds in the two main wind directions: N-NW and S-SE. The time evolution of this initial sedimentary layer permits to determine where and when the erosion would be large enough to be a stressor for the Z.n. restoration. For an extreme erosion rate of 10−3 kg/m2/s, for a strong wind speed of 21 m/s and an initial sedimentary layer of 15 cm, all this layer would be eroded in several nearshore areas after 3 days. The erosion risk is maximum along the eastern shore, where an additive effect of the two opposite winds can be expected. Indeed, S-SE and N-NW winds create coastal jets of opposite direction and of about the same intensity exerting alongshore erosion and deposition at about the same places. The present results concerning the time evolution of erosion depth induced by the wind improve our knowledge of the erosion risk on the Z.n. restoration in EB. They will be useful to appropriately orient the action of politics and managers for a future restoration program. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Loess Plateau is an important region for vegetation restoration in China; however, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nutrients, and stoichiometry after restoration in this vulnerable ecoregion are not well understood. Typical restoration types, including orchardland, grassland, shrubland, and forestland, were chosen to examine changes in the stocks and stoichiometry of SOC, soil total nitrogen (TN), and soil total phosphorus (TP) at different soil depths and recovery times. Results showed that SOC stocks first increased and then stabilized in orchardland, grassland, and shrubland at 0-30 cm depths, while in forestland, SOC stocks gradually increased. Soil TN stocks first increased and then decreased in orchardland, shrubland, and forestland with restoration age at 0-30 cm depths, while soil TP stocks showed little variation between restoration types; at the same time, the overall C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios increased with restoration age. In the later stages of restoration, the stocks of SOC and soil TN at 0-30 cm soil depths were still lower than those in natural grassland and natural forest. Additionally, the SOC, soil TN, and soil TP stocks and the C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios decreased with soil depth. The forestland had the highest rate of change in SOC and soil TN stocks, at 0-10 cm soil depth. These results indicate a complex response of SOC, soil TN, and soil TP stocks and stoichiometry to vegetation restoration, which could have important implications for understanding C, N, and P changes and nutrient limitations after vegetation restoration. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Ceramics are popular as dental restorative materials for missing teeth due to their esthetics, chemical durability and ease of fabrication. Glass ceramics are commonly used for the fabrication of dental inlays, veneers, dental crowns and bridges. Mica containing glass ceramics (SiO2-Al2O3-MgO-K2O-B2O3-F) are one of the potential materials due to their machinability, bioactivity and resemblance to tooth colour. The review aims to provide an overview of dental ceramics with emphasis on mica glass ceramics, and their strengthening mechanisms with nucleating agents. The review discusses the clinically relevant properties of various mica based glass ceramic compositions such as fracture toughness, hardness, bending strength, machinability, wear, translucency and provides recommendations for their biocompatibility testing. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: Assessment of long-term clinical data regarding post-endodontic restorations is essential for the evaluation of different post-and-core concepts. The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of patient self-reporting on post-endodontic restorations after 11 years of clinical service. Materials and methods: Twenty-nine patients (61 ± 15 years old) with endodontic glass-fibre and titanium post-endodontic restorations were examined within the 11-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial. Restorations were assessed by self-reports during a telephone interview (one item), the completion of a four-item questionnaire and clinical and radiographic examination. A gold standard for restoration in situ or ‘failure’ was defined by clinical and radiographic examination. Diagnostic accuracy of patients’ self-reports was evaluated by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV). Results: After a mean observation time of 137 months (min/max: 125/154 months), 25 (86.2%) restorations were in situ and 4 (13.8%) failures were detected. Self-report during a telephone interview and the four-item questionnaire correctly identified all in situ restorations (specificity = both 100%, NPV = 92.6%/96.2%). Self-report during a telephone interview identified two out of four failures (sensitivity = 50%, PPV = 100%), and self-report on the four-item questionnaire identified three out of four failures (sensitivity = 75%, PPV = 100%). Conclusions: When the clinical examination is not feasible, patients’ self-report shows valuable diagnostic potential in the identification of the post-endodontic failure. © 2018, © 2018 Acta Odontologica Scandinavica Society.

AB  - Phenotypic variation is critical for the long-term persistence of species and populations. Anthropogenic activities have caused substantial shifts and reductions in phenotypic variation across diverse taxa, but the underlying mechanism(s) (i.e., phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic evolution) and long-term consequences (e.g., ability to recover phenotypic variation) are unclear. Here we investigate the widespread and dramatic changes in adult migration characteristics of wild Chinook salmon caused by dam construction and other anthropogenic activities. Strikingly, we find an extremely robust association between migration phenotype (i.e., spring-run or fall-run) and a single locus, and that the rapid phenotypic shift observed after a recent dam construction is explained by dramatic allele frequency change at this locus. Furthermore, modeling demonstrates that continued selection against the spring-run phenotype could rapidly lead to complete loss of the spring-run allele, and an empirical analysis of populations that have already lost the spring-run phenotype reveals they are not acting as sustainable reservoirs of the allele. Finally, ancient DNA analysis suggests the spring-run allele was abundant in historical habitat that will soon become accessible through a large-scale restoration (i.e., dam removal) project, but our findings suggest that widespread declines and extirpation of the spring-run phenotype and allele will challenge reestablishment of the spring-run phenotype in this and future restoration projects. These results reveal the mechanisms and consequences of human-induced phenotypic change and highlight the need to conserve and restore critical adaptive variation before the potential for recovery is lost. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (2%), sodium hypochloride (2.5%), ozone gas, and boric acid at different concentrations (1%, 3%, 5%, and 7%) on microleakage from composite restorations. In a total of 80 extracted human canine teeth, a class V cavity was opened on the buccal surface and the samples were separated into eight groups. In the control group, no procedure was applied for cavity disinfection, then composite restoration (Z250, 3M) was made using single-stage, self-etch adhesive (Single Bond 3M). In the other groups, seven different disinfectants were used, then the cavity was restored. The teeth were split into two in the buccolingual direction, parallel to the long axes. Stain penetration was examined under stereomicroscope and scored. Examination with SEM was made on one sample from each group, selected at random. Statistical evaluations were made using Dunnett C Post Hoc Comparison and Kruskal–Wallis H tests. In the occlusal region evaluation, the groups with the lowest level of leakage were the 3% and 5% boric acid groups, and the highest levels of microleakage were determined in the chlorhexidine group and the 1% boric acid group. In the gingival region, the lowest level of microleakage was in the 5% boric acid group and the highest levels were determined in the 1% and 7% boric acid groups. Boric acid disinfectants used at suitable concentrations were not seen to create a risk in respect of microleakage. © 2018, © 2018 International Ozone Association.

AB  - Optical fluorescence imaging methods have a range of forensic applications. The VistaCam system (Dürr Dental) is an existing intra-oral fluorescence camera, which was designed to aid detection of dental caries using 405 nm wavelength light generated by light emitting diodes (LEDs). This study assessed whether this fluorescence imaging device could also be used to recognize dental restorative materials, which is essential for accurate dental charting of deceased persons who are unidentified. The effect of body fluids (saliva and blood) on performance was also assessed. The VistaCam was used on the bench to assess 55 extracted human teeth with restorations, and samples of restorative materials. Readings were first taken in the moist state and then after the application of human saliva or venous blood. Fluorescence scores were compared using one-way ANOVA. Human enamel gave lower fluorescence than restorations. Different tooth-coloured restorative materials gave similar strong fluorescence scores, without statistically significant differences between them. Fluorescence scores were not affected by the presence of ambient fluids (saliva or blood). Using violet 405 nm light to elicit fluorescence may aid in the recognition of dental restorative materials. © 2017, © 2017 Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences.

AB  - In evaporite basins, salt deformation including inflation, diapirism, and salt canopy emplacement is inherently non-coaxial and ductile and thus it presents challenges for two-dimensional kinematic restorations that rely on line-length and area-balancing assumptions. Also, because salt flow and the resulting deformation of adjacent cover units can be driven by temporally and spatially transient salt pressure gradients, kinematic restorations are generally unable to predict the magnitude and distribution of subseismic deformation that results from a particular structural scenario. Here, we use a case study from the Atwater fold belt, Gulf of Mexico, to test a new workflow that involves comparison of kinematic restoration models with forward numerical (finite-element) models of structural evolution to examine the physical validity of solutions derived from the kinematic restorations and to determine the nature and spatial distribution of the resultant subseismic deformation. In the Atwater fold belt, which represents the downdip portion of a linked updip (landward) extensional-downdip (seaward) contractional system, our kinematic restorations indicated that major anticlines likely result from early short wavelength folding followed by (1) inflation of the autochthonous salt to drive failure of the overburden, (2) collapse of the updip limb of the major salt-cored anticline as the salt evacuates updip, and (3) rapid emplacement of the allochthonous salt canopy. In margin scale finite element models of the same system, progradation of the sedimentary wedge above the weak salt substrate leads to basinward migration of the salt and produces inflation of the major downdip salt-cored folds, as predicted by the kinematic model. However, in relatively strong overburden materials (equivalent friction angle = 32°), such salt flow only sustains inflation of the anticlines and is unable to reproduce the interpreted collapse of the anticlinal backlimb or emplacement of the salt canopy. Alternate model runs that include a significant reduction in material strength (equivalent friction angle = 18°) allow salt in the anticlinal crest to drive both reactive and active diapirism and ultimately lead to rapid emplacement of allochthonous canopies. In all of these models, diapirism drives substantial seismically-resolvable and subseismic deformation of wall rocks. Additionally, these models clearly show that the stress field, and particularly the K value (horizontal-vertical stress ratio) of the sediments adjacent to salt structures used for estimating stress magnitudes for drilling predictions, is fundamentally dependent on what point along the evolutionary path from autochthonous salt, to diapir, to salt sheet, that each structure resides. These results highlight the need to test complex kinematic restorations with physics-based techniques. Additionally, they demonstrate that integrating kinematic restorations with these finite element solutions can substantially increase our ability to predict both subseismic reservoir damage in sediments adjacent to salt structures and the K values used for forecasting drilling conditions, particularly in young basins filled with poorly consolidated sediments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The accuracy of measuring inclusion size in direct C-scan image of immersion ultrasonic testing is restricted by the lateral resolution of the focused transducer, even if a high frequency is used, and the blurred edge due to scattering of sound waves at inclusions. In this work, an improved image restoration method that is based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) iterative algorithm is proposed, which is used to restore the C-scan image and improve the accuracy of inclusion size measurement in immersion ultrasonic testing. For the improved RL iterative algorithm, the point spread function (PSF) is derived based on the multi-Gaussian beam model and Kirchhoff approximation, which considers the propagation properties of sound waves at water-steel interface and the spectral characteristics of the transducer with high frequency. In order to determine the final iteration number, the relationship between final iteration number and size of the inclusion in the image is established by restoring the simulated C-scan image and further calibrated with size correction factor. The size correction factor considers the effect of sound attenuation and electro-mechanical transformation encountered in practical testing equipment. Experimental results show that the inclusion sizes measured in restored C-scan images agree well with the optical micrograph results, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018

AB  - Noncoding RNAs are functional RNA molecules that get transcribed from DNA but are not translated into proteins; yet, they can regulate gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Secondary structures present within these RNAs play a major role in determining their nature of function. In the case of miRNAs, the precursor miRNA have a hairpin stem loop structure which is required for Dicer recognition and further maturation. Alternately, it might assume a G-quadruplex structure. The transition from hairpin to G-quadruplex depends upon the nucleotide sequence as well as the cellular microenvironment, and this might affect the miRNA maturation and other downstream activity. Formation of the G-quadruplex within precursor miRNA-149 has been shown to inhibit Dicer processing activity followed by suppression of miRNA-149 maturation in cancer cells. In this report, we show that suppression of cell proliferation by the upregulated miRNA-149 could be rescued by unfolding the G-quadruplex present in pre-miRNA-149 by TmPyP4 (Porphyrin) treatment. Using UV-visible spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry, we observed that TmPyP4 binds strongly to G-quadruplex and unfolds it, which was further verified by NMR spectroscopy. In cellulo, qRT-PCR measurements of miRNA-149 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed concentration dependent enhancement of mature miRNA-149 upon treatment of TmPyP4. As a consequence of enhanced miRNA-149 activity, we also observe the reduction in miRNA-149 target protein ZBTB2 that eventually leads to reduced cell proliferation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate how the thickness variations in ceramic restorations of lithium disilicate and the use of different photopolymerizers influence the degree of conversion of the resin cements. Methods: This study was performed according to the PRISMA checklist. The bibliographic research was performed to identify in vitro studies until December 2017 in the databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The selected studies were submitted to bias risk assessment. In the meta-analysis the data were evaluated using Review Manager Software v.5.3, with random-effect model at a 5% significance level. Results: The meta-analysis in this study showed that despite the translucency of lithium disilicate, significant reduction of light was observed when activated through the ceramic. The degree of conversion was higher in the control groups in which the resin cement was photopolymerized without the interposition of the ceramic material. Conclusions: The thinner the ceramic material, the higher the degree of conversion. A thickness greater than 1.0 mm drastically reduces the degree of conversion of dual-curing or light-curing resins. The curing unit with irradiance of 3200 to 3505 mW/cm2 showed improvements in conversion values. © 2018 by the American College of Prosthodontists

AB  - Background: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with post-traumatic extra-articular deformity (EAD) is difficult to manage using conventional instrumentation techniques. In this study, we evaluate whether accelerometer navigation system can be a valuable option to make accurate bone resections and restore the neutral mechanical axis in complex TKA patients with EAD. Methods: From May 2015 to June 2017, 18 consecutive TKA were performed in 18 patients with knee osteoarthritis with associated EAD. An accelerometer-based navigation system was used to guide tibial and femoral resection in the coronal and sagittal plane. Postoperative lower limb alignment in coronal plane and component position in coronal and sagittal plane was measured through full-leg weight-bearing X-ray. Clinical score were recorded using the Knee Society Score at the final follow-up. Results: The mean hip-knee-ankle angle was 0.9° ± 1.4° varus alignment. The coronal alignment of the femoral component was 89.2° ± 1.9° and the coronal alignment of the tibial component was 89.4° ± 2.1°. The sagittal alignment of the femoral component was 93.2°± 1.9° and the sagittal alignment of the tibial component was 84.4° ± 3.1°. At the final follow-up, the Knee Society Score was 89 points (range, 82-100), and the functional score was 86.7 points (range, 60-100). No intraoperative and postoperative surgical complications were reported using this technology. Conclusion: Accelerometer-based navigation is accurate in achieving neutral mechanical alignment and optimal implant position after TKA in patients with EAD. This system should be considered a valuable option to the more complex technique of computer navigation or robotic surgery. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Landscape change caused by ecological restoration projects has both positive and negative influences on human livelihoods, yet surprisingly little research on the cultural consequences of ecological restoration in agricultural landscapes has taken place. Cultural consequences can be captured in the ecosystem services framework as cultural ecosystem services (CES). However, assessment and valuation of these services to support decision-making for this essential ecosystem is lacking. To help fill this gap, we assessed the opinions of Chinese rural communities about CES and the changes in their perception under the Grain for Green program (GFG), a nationwide program to relieve the pressure on ecosystems (soil erosion and land degradation) by converting cultivated land or barren land on steep slopes into grassland and forests. We used Guyuan City in China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region as a case study, using a workshop to identify the CES provided by the agricultural landscape, followed by semi-structured household interviews to quantify perceptions of these CES. We found that all eight CES types identified by the workshop were perceived by the rural communities. Reforestation changed their perceptions of CES directly due to land cover change and indirectly due to the resulting economic changes and migration of mostly young workers in search of better jobs. Cultivated land was perceived as more important than forest for CES provision. In addition, residential areas were perceived as providing significant CES because of local traditions that produce close and highly social neighborhood bonds in agricultural landscapes. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The use of commercially produced seed material is a common practice in restoration. However, the impact of sowing on genetic variation of natural populations is still unclear. Aim of this study was, therefore, to test if genetic variation within and among populations restored with local seed material corresponds to the genetic variation of neighboring natural populations. We investigated each ten natural and restored populations of three common grassland species (Knautia arvensis, Silene vulgaris and Plantago lanceolata), situated in five study regions in southeastern Germany. Our study revealed significant genetic differentiation between natural and restored populations of the insect-pollinated K. arvensis and S. vulgaris although differentiation was much stronger for K. arvensis since most restored populations contained another ploidy level than natural populations. For the wind-pollinated P. lanceolata, genetic differentiation between natural and restored populations was comparable to the genetic differentiation between its natural populations. Genetic diversity within restored populations of each species was equivalent or even higher than within natural populations. Our study provides evidence that the local genetic structure especially of common insect-pollinated grassland species may be affected by the application of regional seed mixtures in restoration. Regional admixed provenancing in seed production is an important approach to preserve regional patterns and to provide seeds for the reestablishment of genetically variable populations. The method would however be an even more powerful tool in restoration when ploidy levels would be checked before seed production and seed transfer zones would be smaller. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Soil erosion is a widespread environmental problem that threatens environmental sustainability. The Loess Plateau (LP) in China is one of the most severely eroded areas in the world. In this study, the soil erosion dynamics were assessed by applying the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and the Revised Wind Erosion Equation; further, the underlying drivers for soil erosion processes were investigated. In addition, implications of constraint effects in soil erosion control were discussed. The results showed that there was a substantial reduction in both wind and water erosion between 2000 and 2015; it is considered that vegetation restoration (mainly in relation to government-aided ecological restoration programs), increased precipitation, and a decrease in wind speed may have contributed to these trends. Land cover and soil properties contribute to spatial patterns of soil erosion. Thus, ecological restoration programs have promoted improvements in soil properties, leading to an eventual reduction. Constraint line analysis indicates that vegetation cover has a nonlinear and threshold effect on soil erosion through constraining the water condition (i.e., rainfall). With respect to water erosion, when rainfall is below the threshold (approximately 450–500 mm), it is not sufficient to maintain a good vegetation cover (about 30–40%), and vegetation cannot efficiently prevent soil erosion; however, once rainfall exceeds the threshold, the soil retention function of the vegetation is enhanced and soil loss is substantially reduced. In addition, there is a lower (10%) and an upper (40%) threshold at which vegetation can control wind erosion, which implies that plant cover lower than 10% has a minimal effect on reducing the wind velocity at the soil surface, and the effect of vegetation on reducing wind erosion is at its maximum when plant cover is 40% or above. However, if human intervention is removed, the limited amount of rainfall on the LP would be insufficient to support large areas of trees in the long-term; therefore, the constraint effects of the water condition on vegetation cover need to be considered to improve the efficiency of afforestation and reforestation efforts aimed at mitigating and preventing soil loss. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current study used the Attention Restoration Theory to investigate whether plants in an office context produced restorative effects that enable employees to perform better. This study was one of the first attempts to empirically investigate the effect of indoor plants on experiences of performance outcomes within South Africa. In this experimental study, 120 participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) no plants or pictures of plants; (2) only plants; (3) only canvas pictures of plants. The rooms were identical in every other respect. Participants completed two tasks (a card-sorting task and a reading task) and two questionnaires, namely the connectedness to nature scale to assess participant’s nature identity and a perceived task performance questionnaire. The results from the ANOVA’s demonstrated a reduction in participants’ errors (F(2, 117) = 7.137, p =Â 0.001), a positive reaction to the given task (F(2, 117) = 8.904, p =Â 0.000), as well as reduction in participants’ task completion time (F(2, 117) = 43.422, p =Â 0.000) in the plants condition. The result from the two-way ANOVA’s demonstrated that nature identity did not moderate the above relationships (errors: F(1, 114) = 2.060, p = 0.132; completion time: F(1, 114) = 0.967, p = 0.383; reaction to the task: F(1, 114) = 0.017, p = 0.983). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Dune lakes are formed in coastal dune depressions. A group of dune lakes in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, was decreed a Ramsar site and/or a state natural reserve. The objective of this study was to characterize and determine a baseline for these water bodies, both urban and rural, comparing them and establishing the guidelines for their management. The study points out the different threats and actual conditions of rural and urban dunelakes and the need for specific management practices. Our hypothesis stated that human activities around these lakes have an important impact and modify water quality, and that contact with the water table acts as a passive means of restoration. The water of 25 lakes was sampled to determine its quality, and wetland vegetation cover was monitored over time. Water quality was the main difference between urban and rural dune lakes; the latter, surrounded by cattle ranching activities and plantations, have lower concentrations of nitrates, ammonium, orthophosphates and total phosphorus. For management purposes, the lakes were divided into three groups (with subgroups) depending on their water quality, whether they are urban or rural, their size, whether or not they form part of the Ramsar site and/or natural reserve, or lie within the range of expansion of the Port of Veracruz. The management recommendations made for each lake are based on generating and applying current regulations, the enforcement of the law, carrying out infrastructure work, conservation and restoration actions, environmental education, organization and training. These lakes are important natural capital for the city, but management plans and ample participation by society are urgently needed. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - There is a mismatch between large-scale, dynamic, ecological processes and the scales at which individual land management agency units have the capacity and authority to work. To improve environmental governance, scholars across disciplines emphasize the need to work across jurisdictional and organizational boundaries to support collective action and address scale mismatches. An important question now is how to design policies that support collaborative management across jurisdictional boundaries to produce improved outcomes. Our research evaluated the Joint Chiefs Landscape Restoration Partnership, a new policy tool in use by the US federal government to support forest restoration activities across the public-private divide, to investigate two research questions: 1) Did the policy design of the Joint Chiefs Partnership effectively support cross-boundary work? And, 2) What underlying conditions helped or hindered the ability of project participants to undertake cross-boundary work using this policy approach? To glean program-wide understanding of the Joint Chiefs Partnership, we conducted 62 semi-structured interviews with agency staff and external participants in the program. We found that the requirement to collaborate and infusion of committed, multi-year funding supported faster implementation of planned work and increased coordination across jurisdictions and partners. Previously established collaborative relationships were reported as the most critical factor underlying success, while limited agency capacity was reported as significantly impeding project success. Our findings suggest that this policy tool, which incorporates proposed policy design principles to support improved governance, was successful for supporting cross-boundary management and collective action. The results from this study also raise practical questions about tradeoffs under programs that prioritize funding investments and about navigating among the variables that affect policy implementation. Our study contributes to the broader literature on policy design for complex environmental governance challenges and provides an empirical evalution of a policy tool in a specific legal, administrative, and land management context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wetlands in urban and urbanizing areas are often smaller, more degraded, and subject to more stressors than those in undeveloped locations. Their restored level of functioning may never equal that of a site in an undisturbed landscape. Yet, the social benefits from restoring these wetlands may be significant because of the relative scarcity of wetlands and natural areas in urban settings and also the large number of people who may benefit. In this study, we have outlined a systematic approach to compiling nonmonetary indicators of wetlands restoration benefits: The Rapid Benefit Indicators (RBI) Approach. The RBI approach is grounded in economic theory and compatible with methods used by environmental economists to value ecosystem services. We illustrate the RBI approach with a comparison of 2 sites within the Woonasquatucket River Watershed in Rhode Island. As an urbanizing watershed, the Woonasquatucket illustrates how decisions may differ when based primarily on evaluations of ecological functioning versus those that incorporate benefits to people. It demonstrates how small urban sites with relatively low ecological function can provide large social benefits. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:148–159. Published 2018.

AB  - In this study, the improvement of underwater images was re-correct color by design of a new method by using Histogram Equalization Based on Color Restoration (HEBCR). Proposed method adopted on applying traditimal histogram equalization on the image in RGB Model and then performed color correction by using (XYZ, LMS) color spaces and add to that apply logarithm mapping. Quantitative analyses indicate that the proposed method outperforms other methods as Multi Scale Retinex Algorithm with Color Restoration (MSRCR), Integrated Color Model (ICM), Unsupervised Color correction Method (UCM) and Rayleigh Stretching and Averaging Image Planes (RSAIP) by calculating no reference image quality assessments. Finally, we concluded from the results that the proposed HEBCR method is much better than the other methods for enhancement underwater images. © 2019, Medwell Journals.

AB  - Key message: The novel Rfm3 locus causing undesired fertility restoration in the msm1 cytoplasm of winter barley is located on the short arm of chromosome 6H. Abstract: Undesired fertility restoration of cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) mother lines in absence of the functional Rfm1 restorer gene is a significant problem for hybrid breeding in winter barley. Here, we describe that a novel restorer locus on the short arm of chromosome 6H, designated Rfm3, is closely linked to two mitochondrial transcription termination factor family (mTERF) protein coding genes. Genome-wide association studies in a multiparental mapping population revealed that two of the most significantly associated markers are located very close to these genes, with one marker lying directly within one mTERF gene sequence. Sequences of the candidate genes in the parental lines, segregating individuals and an independent set of breeding lines clearly revealed haplotypes discriminating completely sterile, partially fertile and Rfm1-restorer lines. The haplotypes segregate for several single nucleotide polymorphisms, a 6 bp insertion–deletion (InDel) polymorphism and another 2 bp InDel. CMS-unstable genotypes carrying haplotypes associated with undesired fertility restoration showed significantly higher grain setting on bagged spikes when plants were subjected to elevated temperatures during anthesis, indicating a temperature influence on pollen fertility. SNPs associated with desirable Rfm3 haplotypes can be implemented in marker-assisted selection of stable CMS mother lines. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Species with highly restricted ranges are disproportionately at risk of extinction, particularly where habitat loss occurs as a result of mining. Postmining restoration of rare species populations is considered as an appropriate response to counter such threats, but requires a careful, evidence-based, and information-driven approach. The economically important diamond mining at Sendelingsdrif in the southern Namib Desert occurs in the highly diverse Succulent Karoo Biome and threatens a significant part of the population of the narrow endemic succulent plant species Juttadinteria albata. To decrease the inherent risks of restoring such a rare species, we studied the habitat features of premining J. albata populations and experimentally tested whether some features could assist future reintroductions in postmining substrates. Plots where J. albata occurred were mostly south- to west-facing and had among others higher rock cover and steeper slopes than plots where J. albata plants were absent. A revegetation experiment, with J. albata cuttings that were established on postmining substrate mounds, revealed that plants on steeper slopes, facing south to west, grew faster than plants on other slopes and aspects. Slope and aspect are therefore important habitat properties to recreate when restoring J. albata populations.

AB  - Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of class II restorations, in permanent teeth, through the ART technique in comparison to composite resin. Materials and methods: Participants (154), aged 8 to 19 years, with good general health, with class II cavities in permanent teeth, and without pulp involvement and tooth pain were included in this parallel and randomized clinical trial. The Ethics Committee approval number was CAAE: 24012913.0.1001.5417. Seventy-seven restorations were made with each restorative material (Equia Fil-GC Corporation and Z350-3M). Evaluations occurred at 6 and 12 months by the criteria of ART and the USPHS modified. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney, chi-square, Fisher’s exact, chi-square tests with linear trend and logistic regression by enter method (p < 0.050). The Kaplan-Meier test evaluated the survival rates of the restorations. The log-rank test compared the survival curves. Results: Regardless of the evaluation criteria used, the success rates of ART restorations were 98.7% (6 months) and 95.8% (12 months) and for composite resins were 100% (6 months) and 98.7% (12 months), with no statistical difference of restoration groups (p > 0.050). Survival rates for restorations, regardless of the evaluation criteria used, are the same as the success rates, with the exception of ART restorations at 12 months of follow-up (94.8%). Conclusion: No differences in the success rates of class II restorations of ART compared to resin composite, in permanent teeth, were observed after 12 months. Clinic significant: HVGIC can safely be used to restore proximal cavities in permanent teeth up to 12 months. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The depth map obtained by Microsoft Kinect is often accompanied with a large area information loss called black hole. In this paper, an optimal algorithm for image restoration with multi-resolution anisotropic diffusion is proposed to fill the black areas. At the same times, the restriction of anisotropic diffusion algorithm can be broken through by using multi-resolution. Using the color map as a guidance to refine the details of the image. Then according to local adjustment, the error rate can be effectively reduced. At the end of this paper, the joint bilateral filter (JBF) is introduced as a contrast, and the PCL open source point cloud database is used for 3D reconstruction. Compared with competing methods, the proposed algorithm can fill the larger black holes significantly. The experiments show that it also has good performance on reducing the error rate and preserving the edge details. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.

AB  - Cervical spinal cord injury and stroke severely impact grasping movements required for activities of daily living. Intraneural peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) enables specific activation of passing axons and may restore fine grasping in paralysed hands. Here, we assess the feasibility of using intrafascicular electrical stimulation of the arm peripheral nerves to produce precise hand movements in the non-human primate (NHP). Neuroanatomical studies of the NHP arm nerves, computational simulations based on realistic PNS models, and electrophysiology experiments show evidences for the use of intraneural PNS to induce fine hand movements. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the internal adaptation of resin composite restorations in Class I cavities with or without an intermediate layer, and to identify the relationships between the internal adaptation and the polymerization shrinkage parameters of the layer material. Methods: Class I cavities prepared in human third molars were treated with a one-step self-etch adhesive (G-Premio Bond, GC). In the control group, Tetric-EvoCeram Bulk-Fill (TBF, Ivoclar Vivadent) was placed using the bulk-fill technique and then light-cured. In the experimental groups, six different layer materials (three flowable resin composites, two bulk-fill resin composites, and a resin-modified glass-ionomer) were applied to a 1.5-mm thickness and light-cured, which was followed by TBF filling. After thermo-cycling, internal adaptation was measured using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging and compared in terms of high brightness percentage (HB%) to represent the microgap. Shrinkage strain (SS), flexural modulus (FM), and polymerization shrinkage stress of the intermediate layer-resin composite complex (PS) were measured for each material. The relationships among HB%, SS, FM, and PS were evaluated statistically. Results: Groups with an intermediate layer showed lower HB% than the control group. The HB% correlated with PS (Pearson's correlation: R2 = 0.883, p &lt; 0.05), and the PS correlated with the product of SS and FM. Conclusion: Internal adaptation depended on the polymerization shrinkage stress of the intermediate layer-resin composite complex. Clinical significance: Bulk-fill resin composite, which can show low polymerization shrinkage stress, may be used as an intermediate layer for better internal adaptation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Image and video data acquired by portable devices such as mobile phones are degraded by noise and blur due to the small size of optical sensors in these devices. A wide range of image restoration methods exists, yet feasibility of these methods in portable platforms is not guaranteed due to limited hardware resources on such platforms. The paper addresses this problem by focusing on denoising algorithms. We have chosen two representatives of denoising methods with state-of-the-art performance, and propose different parallel implementations and algorithmic simplifications suitable for mobile phones. In addition, an extension to resolution enhancement is presented including both visual and quantitative comparisons. Analysis of the algorithms is carried out with respect to the computation time, power consumption and output image quality. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Species composition is a vital attribute of any ecosystem. Accordingly, ecological restoration often has the original, or “natural,” species composition as its target. However, we still lack adequate methods for predicting the expected time to compositional recovery in restoration studies. We describe and explore a new, ordination regression-based approach (ORBA) for predicting time to recovery that allows both linear and asymptotic (logarithmic) relationships of compositional change with time. The approach uses distances between restored plots and reference plots along the successional gradient, represented by a vector in ordination space, to predict time to recovery. Thus, the approach rests on three requirements: (a) the general form of the relationship between compositional change and time must be known; (b) a sufficiently strong successional gradient must be present and adequately represented in a species compositional dataset; and (c) a restoration target must be specified. We tested the approach using data from a boreal old-growth forest that was followed for 18 years after experimental disturbance. Data from the first 9 years after disturbance were used to develop models, the subsequent 9 years for validation. Rates of compositional recovery in the example dataset followed the general pattern of decrease with time since disturbance. Accordingly, linear models were too optimistic about the time to recovery, whereas the asymptotic models provided more precise predictions. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that the new approach opens for reliable prediction of recovery rates and time to recovery using species compositional data. Moreover, it allows us to assess whether recovery proceeds in the desired direction and to quantitatively compare restoration speed, and hence effectiveness, between alternative management options. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The effects of heating temperature, cooling method, re-curing time and water-to-cement ratio (w/c) on the natural restoration of mechanical properties of concrete exposed to high temperature were experimentally studied. The fire-damaged concrete specimens were re-cured in ambient conditions after they had been rapidly cooled in water and naturally cooled in air. Below 500°C, the natural restoration of the compressive strength of water-cooled concrete was more evident than that of air-cooled concrete. The natural restoration of the compressive strength of air-cooled concrete with low w/c ratio was more obvious than that of concrete with high w/c ratio. After being subjected to 500°C and re-cured for 3 months, the splitting tensile strength decreased to below 26% of the initial value. The splitting tensile strength of water-cooled concrete recovered more evidently than that of the air-cooled concrete. The restoration of elastic modulus was mainly affected by the heating temperature and cooling method. The elastic modulus of water-cooled concrete which had been subjected to 200, 300 and 400°C was obviously restored after being naturally re-cured for 3 months. The effects of w/c on the tensile strength and elastic modulus were not significant. © 2017 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Upper Vistula Basin, series of check dams are located on almost each of mountain stream. These streams are strongly affected by the presence of dams that disrupt the sediment movement in the channel. Moreover, the check dams are in poor technical condition. The current study focuses on the Krzczonówka Stream, a left-bank tributary of the Raba River, where restoration works were undertaken in 2014 involving lowering of a check dam. The aim of the project was the continuity of the stream corridor for fish migration restoration. This paper aims to provide an analysis of the streambed evolution and a numerical analysis of the impact of check dam lowering and removal of sediment, previously accumulated upstream under the geomorphologic conditions in the studied stream after three years of project execution. A 1D sediment transport model was employed to estimate the areas of erosion and deposition throughout the river course. The calculations show that the thickness of the deposited sediment ranged from 0.20 up to 0.91 m at 1.5 km of the reach. The layer thickness deposited form 2.1 to 1.75 km of the reach, is rather thin; subsequently, the layer thickness increases and the highest values are reached at the area of 1.35 - 1.7 km. The local erosion is observed in 1.1 km of the reach. It is very important to note that the identified erosional and accumulation tendencies are the same at corresponding cross sections measured as calculated based on the model. This also provides a practical form of model validation. Additionally, the stream channel evolution on the base on low annual water stages in Krzczonów gauging station, located downstream the dam, indicates that the bottom has increased in this section by about 50 cm. The comparison of cross-sectional geometry in years of 2015-2016 (after flood event) shows that the stream channel moved in the transverse direction (bank erosion and deposition) and the streambed level has changed slightly. Currently, the stream channel does not seem to be in a state of hydrodynamic equilibrium. Thus, further field measurements will try to indicate when this balance is achieved. © 2019, Polish Society of Ecological Engineering (PTIE).

AB  - A progressive method of a worn turbine rotor journal restoration is machining on mounting bearing of turbine plant directly. Grinding head machines rotor journal moving to its axis while the restored journal in its rotation is located on the bearing bottom half. Thus, rotor center position keeps changing, thus, a required circularity accuracy is not achieved. The best law of grinding head radial feed speed variation is one of the methods providing machining accuracy increase. The effect of feed variation on machined surface circularity accuracy for various numbers of worn rotor journal cross section lobes is investigated. The generation of geometry computer modeling using voxel approach has detected that feed variation practically has no effect on circularity accuracy if lobes number is even. However, for the machining of rotor journals with a three-lobed radial section, the sine variation of the radial tool feed is efficient. Machining accuracy has been increased by 20% compared to the case of machining at constant feed. In all cases, using the same number of workpiece spark-out revolutions as the number of workpiece revolutions at constant tool radial feed has an essential effect on circularity accuracy. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this paper, in order to recover more finer details of the image and to avoid the loss of image structure information for image restoration problem, we develop an iterative adaptive weighted core tensor thresholding (IAWCTT) approach based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By observing the decoupling property of the ADMM algorithm, we first propose that the key step to image restoration is to tackle the denoising subproblem efficiently using appropriate prior information. Secondly, by analyzing the properties of the core tensor, we propose that low-rank tensor approximation can be implemented by penalizing the core tensor itself, instead of penalizing the CP rank, Tucker rank or the multilinear rank and Tubal rank. The IAWCTT approach is proposed to solve the denoising subproblem in the ADMM framework, and we claim that such an adaptive weighted scheme is equivalent to a kind of nonconvex penalty for the core tensor; thus, it is unnecessary to use the nonconvex penalty term to induce strong sparse/low-rank solution in image restoration optimization problem, because the scheme that selecting appropriate weights to the convex penalty term can also lead to strong sparse/low-rank solution. Numerical experiments show that our proposed model and algorithm are comparable to other state-of-the-art models and methods. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Ecological restoration projects may provide solutions for degraded ecosystems in estuaries, but are challenging due to complex governance processes. Scientific studies on the latter are limited. The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the governance process aiming at ecological restoration in estuaries. Based on a literature review, five success conditions for ecological restoration projects in estuaries were formulated. These conditions concern: (1) the presence of options for experimentation; (2) the use of the right communication strategies; (3) a pro-active role of key individuals; (4) sufficient project support; (5) active stakeholder and knowledge integration. These conditions were elaborated upon in a case study on the reopening of the sluices in the Dutch Haringvliet and by conducting seven expert interviews. The case study was a clear “example of failure” due to absence of several conditions. We conclude with some recommendations to enhance future ecological restoration projects. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - There are increasing reports of aberrant expression of GATA4, correlated with oncogenesis and malignant progression in some solid tumors, but whether GATA4 functions as an oncogenic driver or a tumor suppressor in carcinogenesis remains controversial. Because the role and mechanism of GATA4 in breast cancer (BrCa) remain poorly understood, we focused on the expression of GATA4 in BrCa cell lines and tissues and its mechanism in breast oncogenesis. Semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect expression of GATA4 in BrCa cell lines and adjacent breast tissues. Methylation statuses of the GATA4 promoter were studied using methylation-specific PCR in BrCa cell lines.The effects of GATA4 on proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle were also analyzed. Compared with adjacent breast tissue, GATA4 expression in BrCa tissue and cell lines was obviously lower and low expression levels of GATA4 predicted poor outcome. Methylation of GATA4 occurred in almost all of BrCa cell lines. GATA4 overexpression decreased viability, invasion, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of MB-231 and BT549 cells, and markedly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Exogenous expression GATA4 accompanied a significant alteration of MMP2, MMP3, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin expression and induction of the caspase-8 pathway. Moreover, GATA4 could directly repress RelA (p65) transcription, reduce the nuclear phosphorylation-p65 and upregulate inhibitor kappa B expression. Altogether, GATA4 plays a tumor-suppressive role via repression of NF-κB signaling in BrCa cells. Our findings suggest that GATA4 is a potential prognostic biomarker and gene therapeutic target for human BrCa. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the wheel/rail adhesion restoration performance of alumina particles and the comparison between the continuous and single application test strategies in twin disc simulation. The results indicate that the single application test strategy performs better on evaluating the adhesion restoring ability of solid particles. In the single application tests, the restored adhesion coefficient increases with the applied alumina quantity and final gets stable when the quantity exceeds 2 g (0.607 g/m). However, the increase of alumina quality could always extend the duration of restored adhesion. The alumina particles at the size in the range of 0.075–0.15 mm showed the best adhesion restoration and the longest duration was achieved at the size of 0.15 mm. In addition, it is observed that the serious damage is mainly caused in the particles crushing process, and will be gradually ground off in the following long running to have no threat on the serving life of the wheel and the rail. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - US west coast populations of the native Olympia oyster Ostrea lurida declined precipitously in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and were often replaced by the non-native Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) by the aquaculture industry. Recovery of native oyster ecosystem services derived from their suspension feeding activities (termed “filtration services” (FS)) often serves as a powerful incentive for restoration of populations of O. lurida along the US west coast despite uncertainty about the potential effects of their filtration activities on concentrations of suspended particulate matter. Here, we provide an improved FS model for O. lurida and C. gigas in Yaquina Bay, OR, that is based on both in situ feeding behavior and the complex hydrodynamics of the estuary. The total area and the order of locations chosen for oyster restoration in Yaquina Bay were examined to determine how oyster FS could be maximized with limited resources. These modeling efforts quantified estimates showing (1) native oysters, if restored in Yaquina Bay to historic levels, may contribute nearly an order of magnitude greater FS than previously estimated; (2) C. gigas contributes significantly greater FS than O. lurida, especially during the wet season; (3) FS provided by either species is highly dependent upon seasonal river forcing and salinity; (4) spatial variation in FS arises from the hydrodynamics of the system, uneven oysters distributions, and upstream pre-filtering. We found that spatially explicit models demonstrated the benefits of prioritizing restoration to areas with the greatest FS potential, rather than placing oysters randomly within historic habitats. Directing restoration in this manner used between 75% (dry season) and 60% (wet season) less of the restored area needed to achieve comparable FS with randomly placed oysters. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the fatigue failure load, number of cycles until failure, and survival probability of adhesively cemented materials with different microstructures (glass-, hybrid- and resin-ceramic) used to manufacture CAD/CAM monolithic restorations. Methods: Disc-shaped specimens (n = 15; Ø = 10 mm; thickness = 1.0 mm) were produced from CAD/CAM blocks as follows: feldspathic (FEL); leucite (LEU); lithium disilicate (LD); zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZRLS); polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN); and resin nanoceramic (RNC). Adhesive cementation was performed onto epoxy discs (dentin analogue- Ø = 10 mm; thickness = 2.5 mm). The cemented assemblies were subjected to fatigue testing using a step–stress approach (400 N–2200 N; step-size of 200 N; 10,000 cycles per step; 1.4 Hz). Fatigue data were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier and Mantel–Cox (log-rank) tests (p < 0.05) and Weibull statistical analysis. Fractographic analysis was also performed. Results: All RNC specimens survived the fatigue test (100% probability of survival at 2200 N; 100,000 cycles) and presented occlusal deformation in response to loading, while all other tested materials failed in distinct loading steps with radial cracks starting from the bonding surface. LD (1146.7 N; 47,333) and ZRLS (1013.3 N; 40,666) materials obtained the highest fatigue failure loads and cycles until failure, meanwhile all PICN specimens failed during the first step (0% probability of survival at 400 N; 10,000). FEL had similar Weibull modulus to LD and ZRLS and higher than LEU for both load and number of cycles outcomes. Significance: The microstructure of adhesively cemented glass-, hybrid- and resin-ceramic CAD/CAM restorative materials influence their response during fatigue testing, which aids in suggesting the best clinical indications. © 2019 The Academy of Dental Materials

AB  - Denitrification accounts for the production of mobile forms of nitrogen (N) for plant uptake, N leaching, and gaseous losses. However, few studies have investigated the potential effects of the natural restoration age on denitrification rates and denitrifying microorganisms, especially in fragile ecosystems in semiarid regions. The potential N gas (N2O and N2) emissions and denitrification rates significantly decreased after abandonment (&lt; 9 years) compared to those of active farmland and then steadily increased as the restoration proceeded, leading to an enhanced soil N loss. The total bacterial and napA gene abundances significantly decreased after abandonment (&lt; 9 years) compared to that of farmland and then significantly increased as the restoration proceeded. The abundances of the narG, nirK, nirS, qnorB, and nosZ genes steadily increased with the restoration age of abandoned farmland. The community compositions of denitrifying bacteria exhibited different fluctuating patterns, suggesting different response patterns of community traits of N gas emission–related functional guilds to the restoration age of abandoned farmland. Changes in N gas emissions and in the abundance and diversity of denitrifying microorganisms exhibited similar patterns, suggesting an increased population and diversity of denitrifying bacteria are responsible for the enhanced N gas emissions. We observed clear patterns of plant coverage and denitrifying microorganisms that were associated with increases in the organic C, NH4 +-N, and NO3 −-N contents and decreases in the soil bulk density as well as increases in the abundance and diversity of denitrifiers with the restoration age of abandoned farmland that were linked to an increase in N gas emissions. It is therefore recommended that effective measures (i.e., modest levels of grazing) may be able to be undertaken to assist with decreasing greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and N loss after 32 years of farmland abandonment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The roof structure of the 17th century Skokloster castle has recently been restored. The task of finding a solution to the restoration of the timber structure was delicate, as: (a) the roof structure has a highly complex structural behaviour; (b) Skokloster Castle is of remarkably high cultural value; (c) Skokloster Castle has a specific role in Swedish restoration history, as it contributed in the 1960s and 70s to the establishment of a new ideological approach, characterised by the ambition to make as gentle interventions as possible; and (d) successful restoration required methods that would allow for close collaboration and dialogue between the engineers, the architect and the craftsmen. The roof structures were documented by traditional measuring techniques and with laser scanning techniques. Comparative studies of European baroque roof structures were carried out. Modelling and FEM analysis were undertaken to assess the structural behaviour and to design restoration measures. The simulations made using FEM were also combined with visualisation to support the dialogue between the engineers, the architect and the craftsmen. The design of the roof structure has similarities with comparable 17th century roof structures in central European countries, but without some of their qualities. The structure had poorly designed corners, causing weaknesses in the structure. Restoration measures carried out in the 1970s were found to be ineffective. The solution involved an amelioration of the original design, based on designs found in 17th century literature as well as in archetypes found in Romanian Baroque roofs. © 2019, RILEM.

AB  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have attracted broad attention as a novel approach for using economic incentives to provide ecosystem services more sustainably. However, there have been inadequate efforts addressing the basic question of how to design and execute PES at the program level. By comparing and contrasting the experiences of restoring degraded cropland to forest and grass covers in China and the U.S., this paper aims to tackle that question and provide some valuable and timely policy insights that can inform China and other countries of how to improve the performance of their PES programs in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and/or equity. Our analysis will unfold through examining such specific question as: What are the socioeconomic and environmental backgrounds for one country to launch a large PES program? How was it designed initially and has evolved over time? How has its performance been evaluated and what are the main outcomes? How likely is it for the enrolled land to be reconverted or for the contract to be expired? What are the primary challenges to its long-term success? Finally, this study calls for a more practical and focused approach to PES design, implementation, and evaluation that will lead to improved outcomes of forest and grassland ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As a significant technique in machine condition monitoring, wear debris analysis enables investigation of machine running condition with respect to debris features including size, quantity and morphology. In particular, being capable of providing more comprehensive morphological information, three-dimensional debris features are regarded essential and often acquired through a video-based debris imaging process. However, debris images captured often suffer degradation due to debris motion blur and lubrication contamination, that hinder reliable debris features extraction. To address the image degradation issue, a new method of wear debris image restoration is developed to reduce the effect of blur. In order to avoid the expensive computation involved in blind deconvolution methods, the debris image was restored using localized boundary features. Based on the fact that debris area and background area indicate distinctive brightness, a step edge model is applied to describe the original debris boundary. Localized kernels on each side of debris are then determined. Next, restorations are conducted with the estimated kernels to produce sharper debris profiles with respect to different motion features. Final restoration is conducted by fusing the restored profiles according to the maximum local sharpness. Experimental results have demonstrated that this method allows reliable features extraction from blurred image, improving the robustness of video based wear debris analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Statement of problem: Even if the appropriate resin shade is selected for an interim restoration, how the optical characteristics of the interim cement affect the esthetics of the interim restoration is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of interim cements on the optical properties of interim restorations. Material and methods: Twenty dentin disks (6×1 mm) were obtained from the labial surface of bovine incisors. Disks of acrylic and bis-acrylic resins (n=20) with the same dimensions were prepared and cemented over the dentin using the following cements: Bifix Temp (resin-based; VOCO), ClearTemp LC (resin-based; Ultradent Products, Inc), Provicol (VOCO), TempCem NE (Coltène). The same dentin and resin disks were used for all cements. After cementation, the color difference (ΔE00), translucency parameter (TP), and fluorescence of the dentin/cement/resin combinations were compared with each other and with a control group (C), in which a transparent liquid (polyethylene glycol 400; LabSynth) was applied. Color and translucency were evaluated with a spectrophotometer (CM-2600; Konica Minolta) and fluorescence with a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5301PC; Shimadzu). ΔE00 and TP data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA. For fluorescence, 1-way ANOVA was used. The Tukey test was used for multiple comparisons (α=.05). Results: ΔE00 values were significantly influenced by the interim material (P&lt;.001) and the interim cement (P&lt;.001). Bifix Temp showed the lowest significant ΔE00 values (P&lt;.001). The highest ΔE00 values were observed for TempCem NE. No differences were observed between the interim resins with respect to TP (P=.318). The lowest translucency values were measured for TempCem NE, followed by Provicol, ClearTemp LC, Bifix Temp, and the control group (P&lt;.001), with no significant differences among the interim resin-based cements. Among the cements, Bifix Temp and TempCem NE yielded fluorescence similar to that of the natural tooth for both interim resins. A similar result was found for bis-acrylic resin combined with Provicol. Conclusions: Cementation with interim resin-based cements resulted in better esthetics. However, the high fluorescence of the ClearTemp LC may reduce the esthetics of interim restorations in environments with predominantly UV light. © 2018 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry

AB  - Lime-based mortars were mainly used in buildings until the second half of the 19th century, when they started being increasingly replaced by a new binder: Portland cement. And then at the first of 20th century, the cement had become the key role as the binder of renders at Shanghai Modern historic architecture. Those finishing coats show different style: plaster (stucco), fair faced brick, stone coat, etc. The prevalent finish coats were applied with cement-based render as a result of economic way to imitate the stone texture, which includes the water brush stone (It is called Shanghai plaster as well later), pebble dash, artificial stone with chopping (called Zhanjiashi in Chinese), wet dash, Terrozzo, Mane brush drag Sgraffito (called Lamao in Chinese including different statement) at the first half of last century. Some former restoration on renders was discovered to replace the original materials and change the original texture or even the color since the research and analysis on the binder and aggregate was neglected, which is too far from authenticity principle. This paper aims to discuss the restoration method on cement-based renders by analyzing data of lab experiment with petrography and wet-chemical method. Instead of just simply repeating the principle quoted from established standards, the paper tends to provide realistic goals and information to get a more rational and sustainable restoration method in order to avoid the damage coming from unqualified restoration as well as get the authentic texture and color as original facade showed. © 2019, RILEM.

AB  - High spatial resolution Earth observation imagery is considered desirable for many scientific and commercial applications. Given repeat multi-angle imagery, an imaging instrument with a specified spatial resolution, we can use image processing and deep learning techniques to enhance the spatial resolution. In this paper, we introduce the University College London (UCL) MAGiGAN super-resolution restoration (SRR) system based on multi-angle feature restoration and deep SRR networks. We explore the application of MAGiGAN SRR to a set of 9 MISR red band images (275 m) to produce up to a factor of 3.75 times resolution enhancement. We show SRR results over four different test sites containing different types of image content including urban and rural targets, sea ice and a cloud field. Different image metrics are introduced to assess the overall SRR performance, and these are employed to compare the SRR results with the original MISR input images and higher resolution Landsat images, where available. Significant resolution improvement over various types of image content is demonstrated and the potential of SRR for different scientific application is discussed. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This article describes a workflow based on a top-down approach to provide a fixed-type immediate interim restoration after placing a single implant using a digitally driven surgical guide and a matrix-positioning device. A characteristic of the technique is that both the surgical guide and the matrix-positioning device are fabricated from a single diagnostic virtual trial restoration designed on computer-aided design (CAD) software. This workflow may shorten the time required for chairside placement of an interim restoration and enhance esthetics when rehabilitating anterior teeth. © 2018 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry

AB  - During a major outage in a secondary network distribution system, distributed generators (DGs) connected to the primary feeders as well as the secondary network can be used to serve critical loads. This paper proposed a resilience-oriented method to determine restoration strategies for secondary network distribution systems after a major disaster. Technical issues associated with the restoration process are analyzed, including the operation of network protectors, inrush currents caused by the energization of network transformers, synchronization of DGs to the network, and circulating currents among DGs. A look-ahead load restoration framework is proposed, incorporating technical issues associated with secondary networks, limits on DG capacity and generation resources, dynamic constraints, and operational limits. The entire outage duration is divided into a sequence of periods. Restoration strategies can be adjusted at the beginning of each period using the latest information. Numerical simulation of the modified IEEE 342-node low voltage networked test system is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2010-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Bendway weirs (B.W.), known as new and innovative river training structures, are positioned from the outer bank of the river bend and angled upstream toward the flow. In order to investigate the effect of bendway weirs on the sediment process, experiments were conducted in a 90° bend with a relative curvature of 3.3 with and without bendway weirs. Following the installation of bendway weirs with different crest slopes, the scour and sedimentation patterns were evaluated under clear water conditions. To this end, a series of B.W. (7 weirs) with three crest slopes (0, 5, and 10 percent) were installed at the outer bank side in different hydraulic conditions. Erodible bed topography measurements revealed that the maximum scour depth occurred at the tip of the first and last weirs. Moreover, the findings of this study clearly demonstrates the potential of bendway weirs in modifying morphology of river bends and their efficiency in reducing erosion and sedimentation. In general, compared to non-weirs condition, the eroded sediment volume increased by 53, 36, and 15 percent due to the installation of weirs with crest slopes of 0, 5, and 10 percent, respectively. Finally, this study revealed that the maximum scour depth decreased with an increase in the crest slope. © 2018 International Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division

AB  - Objective: Although atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) is considered to be a good option for anxious patients, there is a lack of information whether ART associated to oral health educational strategy (OHES) would positively influence the level of anxiety and stress in children. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of OHES on anxiety and stress markers of schoolchildren submitted to ART. Design: A sample of 78 six- to eight-year-old schoolchildren, with carious lesions in dentin, were randomly divided into groups: OHES + ART-group (n = 39) and ART-group (n = 39). OHES consisted of an educational interactive strategy performed once a week for four weeks. ART was performed using a standardized procedure with hand instruments and glass-ionomer cement. Anxiety and stress markers were assessed subjectively by the modified Venham Picture Test (m-VPT), modified Venham Anxiety Scale (m-VAS), while objective measures consisted of heart rate (HR) and salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels evaluated before, during and after treatment. Results: The two groups did not differ in the perceived anxiety and in anxious behavior, and the variation along the treatment was not significant in both groups (p > 0.05). Both groups also showed higher HR “Before ART-restoration” than the other time-points as an anticipatory anxiety. ART group showed higher HR than OHES + ART group during the “Explanation of procedure” (p = 0.041) and “Deep excavation” (p = 0.018), and only ART group showed higher amylase levels “Before ART” compared to “After ART” (p = 0.004). Conclusions: It was concluded that OHES associated with ART showed a positive effect in modulating heart rate and alpha-amylase levels, that is, those markers of stress objectively measured during ART-restoration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The paper illustrates the damages occurred to masonry buildings due to incorrect consolidation interventions dated back to the 1980s that, according to the culture of the time, were oriented to the replacement of structural elements with new heavy ones, thus changing the static scheme. The case study concerns the seventeenth century church of Saint Mary of Itria in Piazza Armerina, affected in 2007 by the collapse of the one side wall of the apse. After illustrating the historical evolution and the actual state of the building, the investigations carried out to identify the causes of collapse and provide for appropriate reconstruction interventions are reported. The results of hydro-geological and geotechnical surveys lead to exclude foundations subsidence from the causes of the collapse. The study is focused on the analysis of the interventions carried out between 1980 and 1985 for the replacement of the existing wooden covering with girder and hollow block floors, connected with RC curb. The structural analysis was carried out under two load conditions before the collapse with the existing RC roof and with the previous wooden one, showed irrelevant load increase. Thus, the cause of collapse was identified in a variation on the load distribution. The planned intervention concerned the reconstruction of the wall with collapse recovery stones and blocks of similar physical-mechanical properties, the improvement of the walls resistance with mortar injections, the construction of curbs on the top of the walls, the stretching of transversal tie-rods and the introduction of new ones. © 2019, RILEM.

AB  - A recent global trend toward retirement of farmland presents opportunities to reclaim habitat for threatened and endangered species. We examine habitat restoration opportunities in one of the world’s most converted landscapes, California’s San Joaquin Desert (SJD). Despite the presence of 35 threatened and endangered species, agricultural expansion continues to drive habitat loss in the SJD, even as marginal farmland is retired. Over the next decades a combination of factors, including salinization, climate change, and historical groundwater overdraft, are projected to lead to the retirement of more than 2,000 km2 of farmland in the SJD. To promote strategic habitat protection and restoration, we conducted a quantitative assessment of habitat loss and fragmentation, habitat suitability, climatic niche stability, climate change impacts, habitat protection, and reintroduction opportunities for an umbrella species of the SJD, the endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila). We use our suitability models, in conjunction with modern and historical land use maps, to estimate the historical and modern rate of habitat loss to development. The estimated amount of habitat lost since the species became protected under endangered species law in 1967 is greater than the total amount of habitat currently protected through public ownership and conservation easement. We document climatic niche contraction and associated range contraction away from the more mesic margins of the species’ historical distribution, driven by the anthropogenic introduction of exotic grasses and forbs. The impact of exotic species on G. sila range dynamics appears to be still unfolding. Finally, we use NASA fallowed area maps to identify 610 km2 of fallowed or retired agricultural land with high potential to again serve as habitat. We discuss conservation strategies in light of the potential for habitat restoration and multiple drivers of ongoing and historical habitat loss.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a novel combination of a character-level recurrent neural-network based model and a language model applied to diacritics restoration. In many cases in the past and still at present, people often replace characters with diacritics with their ASCII counterparts. Despite the fact that the resulting text is usually easy to understand for humans, it is much harder for further computational processing. This paper opens with a discussion of applicability of restoration of diacritics in selected languages. Next, we present a neural network-based approach to diacritics generation. The core component of our model is a bidirectional recurrent neural network operating at a character level. We evaluate the model on two existing datasets consisting of four European languages. When combined with a language model, our model reduces the error of current best systems by 20% to 64%. Finally, we propose a pipeline for obtaining consistent diacritics restoration datasets for twelve languages and evaluate our model on it.

AB  - China began implementing the world's most ambitious afforestation and forest conservation projects in 2000s. However, whether the forest restoration efforts facilitate forest recovery, and whether the changes in land-use/land-cover (LULC) driven by afforestation projects affect ecosystem services remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the changes in LULC and water-related ecosystem services (i.e., water yield, water purification, and soil conservation) using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Service and Tradeoffs) model in China's Han River basin, the water source region of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (Middle Route). Our study indicated that forest restoration projects greatly facilitated conversion of shrublands and croplands into forests, which dominated the LULC change (LULCC) and subsequently improved the water purification and soil conservation services but slightly decreased water yield services during 2000–2010. By excluding the influence of climatic factors, we found that 4.79 × 108 m3 of water yield were reduced by LULCC, which equals to 0.69% of water yield in 2000. In contrast, the LULCC improved soil conservation services markedly and reduced 1.72 × 107 t sediment, i.e., 12.8% of sediment export in 2000. Meanwhile, 761.7 t nitrogen loading was cut down by the LULCC. The Danjiangkou Reservoir subwatershed, the water supply site for the water transfer project, showed a net decrease of 302 t nitrogen loading from 2000 to 2010. Although the nitrogen loading showed a decreasing trend in 40 out of 50 subwatersheds during 2000–2010, ten subwatersheds showed increasing trends, including the Ren River, Laoguan River, Bai River, Diao River, Youshui River, Tang River, Han River, Xushui River, Sanjia River, and Dan River. These regions should be taken as the priorities for ecosystem restoration and environmental management in the future. © 2018

AB  - Extreme weather events have a significant impact on the aging and outdated power distribution infrastructures. These high-impact low-probability events often result in extended outages and loss of critical services, thus, severely affecting customers' safety. This calls for the need to ensure the resilience in distribution networks by quickly restoring the critical services during a disaster. This paper presents an advanced feeder restoration method to restore critical loads using distributed energy resources (DERs). A resilient restoration approach is proposed that jointly maximizes the amount of restored critical loads and optimizes the restoration times by optimally allocating grids available DER resources. The restoration problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program with the objective of maximizing the resilience to postrestoration failures while simultaneously satisfying grids critical connectivity and operational constraints and ensuring a radial operation for a given open-loop feeder configuration. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the IEEE 123-node feeder with five DERs supplying 11 critical loads and the IEEE 906-bus feeder with three DERs supplying 17 critical loads. The impacts of DER availability and fuel reserve on restored networks are assessed and it is shown that the proposed approach is successfully able to restore a maximum number of critical loads using available DERs. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This article presents a statistical and visual comparison of water quality changes caused by a large river restoration project. Since water quality data are often shown as a non-normal distribution with high seasonal variations, appropriate statistical methods should be selected according to data characteristics for accurate scientific decision-making. In this study, a normality test was first performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and two statistical comparison tests were then performed, including the paired T-test and the sign-test. Seasonality was considered by comparing monthly data pairs. In addition, a diagonal pair comparison plot was proposed as a visual comparison method. This plot is a graphic data display, where monthly paired water quality is represented by X-Y coordinates. From this study, it was concluded that the series of statistical and visual methods would be suggested for comparison of non-normally distributed water quality with high seasonal variations. © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - In multiple sclerosis, demyelination occurs as a consequence of chronic autoimmunity in the central nervous system causing progressive neurological impairment in patients. After a demyelinating event, new myelin sheaths are formed by adult oligodendroglial progenitor cells; a process called remyelination. However, remyelination often fails in multiple sclerosis due to insufficient recruitment and differentiation of oligodendroglial precursor cells. A pivotal role for the two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channel, TASK1, has already been proven for an animal model of multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanisms underlying the TASK1-mediated effects are still elusive. Here, we tested the role of TASK1 channels in oligodendroglial differentiation and remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination in male mice. We found TASK1 channels to be functionally expressed on primary murine and human, pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes. Lack of TASK1 channels resulted in an increase of mature oligodendrocytes in vitro as well as a higher number of mature oligodendrocytes and accelerated developmental myelination in vivo. Mechanistically, Task1-deficient cells revealed a higher amount of phosphorylated WNK1, a kinase known to be involved in the downstream signaling of the myelination regulator LINGO-1. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of genetic TASK1 ablation or pharmacological TASK1 inhibition on disease-related remyelination. Neither channel inhibition nor lack of TASK1 channels promoted remyelination after pathological demyelination. In summary, we conclude that functional TASK1 channels participate in the modulation of differentiating oligodendroglial cells in a previously unknown manner. However, while being involved in developmental myelination our data suggest that TASK1 channels have no major effect on remyelination. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Image enhancement is one of the key concerns pertaining to better quality image photography captured through modern digital cameras. Probability of digital images getting compromised through lightning and weather conditions remains high. Due to these environmental limitations, many a time loss of information from images is reported. Major role of image amplification is to bring out hidden details of an image from the sample. It provides multiple options for enhancing the visual quality of images. This paper addresses problem of early skin cancer detection using image enhancement techniques and presents a multi-scale retinex with color restoration (MSR-CR) technique for skin cancer detection. The actual skin portion suffering from cancer is identified by comparing enhanced image with available ground truth image. Experimental result shows significant improvement over previously available techniques. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019

AB  - A novel filter design for the restoration of the corrupted digital image is proposed in this paper. The filter design incorporates type II fuzzy system and cuckoo search optimization algorithm (T2FCS) based filter design for the restoration of the noise in the images. The noisy pixels in the images are detected using the proposed circular based searching scheme and the detected corrupt pixels are removed using the cuckoo search algorithm. The enhanced pixels in place of the corrupt pixels are acquired using the proposed type II fuzzy system. The proposed filter adapts to various noisy conditions such as random noise, salt and pepper noise and scratch noise. The experimentation of the proposed filter design is carried out over two images. The performance of the proposed T2FCS filter design is compared over the existing image restoration algorithms using metrics; Peak Signal to Noise ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Second Derivative Like Measure of Enhancement (SDME). The result obtained favours the performance of the proposed filter in the restoration of the noisy images. © 2018

AB  - The restoration project concerns of the 19th century Ottoman hammam of Kastellorizo. The hammam is a bath installation of the Muslim quarter in the unique settlement of the most remote Greek island in the southeastern Aegean Sea. Before restoration, it was abandoned and downgraded, despite its location adjacent to the most powerful landmark of the island, the “Red Castle”, at the highest point of the Kavos promontory. With the initiative of “Friends of Kastellorizo”, the vision of preserving and enhancing the hammam in order for it to be fully and functionally restored, was realised. The hammam is a small building of general external dimensions 4.15Â ×Â 3.95Â m covered with a dome. It comprises only a hot room, with a separate narrow space attached for the water tank with the furnace underneath. Due to a long period of neglect, the hammam had lost many of its basic elements. These were both structural and functional, such as the hypocaust, the furnace, the staircase, the doors, the basins, tabs etc. Restoring the monument was a very challenging and multifaceted task. Apart from restoring the functional network in traditional terms, we had to respect all historical layering such as the Italian graffiti and inscriptions from WWII. Conservation methods and non-destructive methods for construction analysis and network inspection had to be employed. Thus, the approach was interdisciplinary, with many specialists working together with the aim of re-integrating the monument into the local community, by completely recovering its original state and reinstating its function as a bath. © 2019, RILEM.

AB  - A comprehensive knowledge of the optical properties of composite resins is essential to achieving optimal results in direct anterior restorations. This case report describes an anterior composite resin restoration fabricated with a layering technique and explains how to use a simple photographic method to verify that the desired optical effects are reproduced. A Class IV restoration was completed on a maxillary central incisor with the help of a silicone guide. An esthetic result was achieved through careful color examination as well as material selections that were based on knowledge of the translucency, opacity, and fluorescence of the chosen direct composite resins. The approach of combining a composite resin designed for bleached teeth with highly opalescent and translucent resins as well as matching the natural dental anatomy provided excellent esthetic results. The suitable reproduction of optical characteristics was confirmed by increasing the contrast of the final photograph, which highlighted the translucency achieved in the area of the mamelons.

AB  - Rapid modernization has brought about massive changes in the urban and rural landscapes of China. While many old places and ancient buildings have been pulled down and replaced with more modern alternatives, others have been protected and restored. These include ancient ancestral temples, an important cultural space in China. Previous research has shown how different level governments and rural communities work together to restore ancient temples, but didn’t bring to light artistic and non-government financed and patronized cases of restoration projects. This article adopts a bottom-up perspective to examine a case in Guangzhou how an individual artist transforms an ancient ancestral temple into a new cultural space. Through an ethnographic-style exploration of the practice of restoration, we unfold the interconnections between an individual’s social memory of the past, their love of place, and their enthusiasm for restoration work. Differing from the government’s ‘standardized’ and functionalist restoration of ancestral temples, this case study shows an individual’s emotional and material devotion to transforming a neglected ancestral temple into an eclectic cultural space where the art works are a result of freedom of creative expression. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The abnormal occlusal contact can disrupt the coordination and health of the oral jaw system. Therefore, the dynamic adjustment of the occlusal surface is of great significance for assessing the status of occlusal contact and clarifying jaw factors of stomatognathic system diseases. To solve this problem, a trajectory subtraction algorithm based on screw theory to improve the accuracy of the occlusal movement trajectory is proposed in our paper. Driving by the relative trajectory, a virtual dynamic occlusal adjustment system is developed to realize 3D occlusal movement simulating, automatic occluding relation detection, and automatic occlusal adjustment. Furthermore, we adapt an active occlusal adjustment method based on Laplacian deformation to increase the contact areas of the occlusal surface, which can aid dentists to realize the automatic adjustment of the non-interference regions. As a consequence, the proposed subtraction algorithm is feasible and the root-mean-square is 0.097 mm, and the adjusted occlusal surface is more consistent with the natural occlusal morphology.

AB  - Coral restoration is increasingly used globally as a management tool to minimize accelerating coral reef degradation resulting from climate change. Yet, the science of coral restoration is still very focused on ecological and technical considerations, impeding the understanding of how coral restoration can be used to improve reef resilience in the context of socio-ecological systems. Here, we visited four well-established coral restoration projects in different regions of the world (Thailand, Maldives, Florida Keys, and US Virgin Islands), and conducted key-informant interviews to characterize local stakeholder's perceptions of the key benefits and limitations associated with restoration efforts. Our results reveal that perceptions around coral reef restoration encompass far more than ecological considerations, and include all four dimensions of sustainability: ecological, social, economic, and governance, suggesting that effective coral restoration should be guided by the principles of sustainability science. Socio-cultural benefits were the most frequently mentioned (72.4% of all respondents), while technical problems were the most common theme for limitations of coral restoration efforts (58.3% of the respondents). Participants also revealed some key points likely to improve the outcomes of coral restoration efforts such as the need to better embrace socio-cultural dimensions in goal setting, evaluate ecological outcomes more broadly, secure long-term funding and improve management and logistics of day to day practices. While we identify several important limitations of coral reef restoration, particularly around amateur workforces and limited involvement of local communities, our results suggest that coral restoration can be used as a powerful conservation education tool to provide hope, enhance agency, promote stewardship and strengthen coral reef conservation strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, is a Grade-I heritage structure. The reinforced concrete cantilever sunshades in this building are at a height of about 20 m above ground and span about two-kilometer along the perimeter of the building. In the late 1990s, some sunshades experienced corrosion and were repaired using polymer modified cementitious mortar. However, these repaired sunshades and others are now exhibiting severe corrosion and concrete spalling- posing a serious falling hazard for visitors and inhabitants. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the concrete used in the sunshades and the assessment of corrosion and structural conditions of the sunshades. Concrete was found to be made of non-hydraulic lime and carbonated - indicating high probability of corrosion. Hence, about 200 sunshade locations from various parts of the building were visually and non-destructively assessed and distress-maps were developed. For this, an instrumented hammer was used on 15 test points per sunshade panel area (of about 1 × 2Â m size). Based on the impulse waveform patterns, estimated strengths and visible damage, the panels were classified into distress levels of negligible, moderate and severe. About 58 to 86% of the sunshades were found to be severely damaged. Also, service level load test was conducted (upto a load of 75Â kN) at a representative location, to assess the effect of corrosion on the load-deflection behaviour of the cantilever. The possible repair strategy and challenges associated with adopting conventional methods, are discussed in the paper. © 2019, RILEM.

AB  - Injury to the central nervous system (CNS) can leave patients with devastating neurological deficits that may permanently impair independence and diminish quality of life. Recent insights into how the CNS responds to injury and reacts to critically timed interventions are being translated into clinical applications that have the capacity to drastically improve outcomes for patients suffering from permanent neurological deficits due to spinal cord injury, stroke, or other CNS disorders. The translation of such knowledge into practical and impactful treatments involves the strategic collaboration between neurosurgeons, clinicians, therapists, scientists, and industry. Therefore, a common understanding of key neuroscientific principles is crucial. Conceptually, current approaches to CNS revitalization can be divided by scale into macroscopic (systems-circuitry) and microscopic (cellular-molecular). Here we review both emerging and well-established tenets that are being utilized to enhance CNS recovery on both levels, and we explore the role of neurosurgeons in developing therapies moving forward. Key principles include plasticity-driven functional recovery, cellular signaling mechanisms in axonal sprouting, critical timing for recovery after injury, and mechanisms of action underlying cellular replacement strategies. We then discuss integrative approaches aimed at synergizing interventions across scales, and we make recommendations for the basis of future clinical trial design. Ultimately, we argue that strategic modulation of microscopic cellular behavior within a macroscopic framework of functional circuitry re-establishment should provide the foundation for most neural restoration strategies, and the early involvement of neurosurgeons in the process will be crucial to successful clinical translation.

AB  - Despite billions of dollars spent on various river restoration techniques, we still find ourselves debating whether habitat restoration increases fish abundance or concentrates fish. Based on the available literature, I discuss three important questions related specifically to the restoration of salmonid habitat: (1) “Does river restoration increase fish abundance or concentrate fish?”; (2) “Does river restoration increase fish survival or increase abundance?”; and (3) “Does the size or amount of river restoration influence fish response?” First, there is scant evidence to support the contention that river restoration leads to the concentration of fish at restoration projects. Second, the literature suggests that river restoration may lead to increased survival, increased abundance, or both. Third, recent studies have found little relationship between restoration project length and physical or biological response. The scientific literature does suggest that fish response to restoration varies greatly depending on the watershed template, location, and characteristics of the habitat restoration, and the life history of and limiting factors for a species. Thus, adequately determining whether changes in fish abundance observed in a restored area are due to increased movement, survival, or the amount of restoration will require detailed monitoring of these factors simultaneously. © 2018 American Fisheries Society

AB  - We have shown that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) downregulates tetrahydrobiopterin salvage enzyme DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) to result in eNOS (endothelial NO synthase) uncoupling and elevated blood pressure. Here, we aimed to delineate molecular mechanisms underlying H2O2 downregulation of endothelial DHFR by examining transcriptional pathways hypothesized to modulate DHFR expression and effects on blood pressure regulation of targeting these novel mechanisms. H2O2 dose and time dependently attenuated DHFR mRNA and protein expression and enzymatic activity in endothelial cells. Deletion of E2F-binding sites, but not those of Sp1 (specificity protein 1), abolished H2O2 attenuation of DHFR promoter activity. Overexpression of E2F1/2/3a activated DHFR promoter at baseline and alleviated the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on DHFR promoter activity. H2O2 treatment diminished mRNA and protein expression of E2F1/2/3a, whereas overexpression of E2F isoforms increased DHFR protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated direct binding of E2F1/2/3a to the DHFR promoter, which was weakened by H2O2. E2F1 RNA interference attenuated DHFR protein levels, whereas its overexpression elevated tetrahydrobiopterin levels and tetrahydrobiopterin/dihydrobiopterin ratios in vitro and in vivo. In Ang II (angiotensin II)-infused mice, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of E2F1 markedly abrogated blood pressure to control levels, by restoring endothelial DHFR function to improve NO bioavailability and vasorelaxation. Bioinformatic analyses confirmed a positive correlation between E2F1 and DHFR in human endothelial cells and arteries, and downregulation of both by oxidized phospholipids. In summary, endothelial DHFR is downregulated by H2O2 transcriptionally via an E2F-dependent mechanism, and that specifically targeting E2F1/2/3a to restore DHFR and eNOS function may serve as a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of hypertension.

AB  - For tropical forest restoration to result in long-term biodiversity gains, native trees must establish self-sustaining populations in degraded sites. While many have asked how seedling recruitment varies between restoration treatments, the long-term fate of these recruits remains unknown. We address this research gap by tracking natural recruits of 27 species during the first 7 years of a tropical forest restoration experiment that included both planted and naturally regenerating plots. We used an individual-based model to estimate the probability that a seedling achieves reproductive maturity after several years of growth and survival. We found an advantage for recruits in naturally regenerating plots, with up to 40% increased probability of reproduction in this treatment, relative to planted plots. The demographic advantage of natural regeneration was highest for mid-successional species, with relatively minor differences between treatments for early-successional species. Our research demonstrates the consequences of restoration decision making across the life cycle of tropical tree species. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS

AB  - Streams and riparian zones are highly heterogeneous ecosystems. Their high biodiversity is promoted by variable flow velocities and water depths, strong hydrological gradients and disturbance regimes. However, human interventions like damming and channelization have degraded these ecosystems world-wide. And, although restoration efforts have increased in the past decades, ecological improvement is lagging. We assessed vegetation development in channelized lowland stream valleys in the Netherlands, combining innovative restoration measures to the stream and stream valleys. This “stream valley restoration” entailed construction of narrower and shallower channels to increase flow velocities during base discharges, meandering of the watercourse to increase flow and depth heterogeneity and excavation of banks to create wide v-shaped stream valleys. We evaluated the effects on functional aspects of the developing in-stream and riparian vegetation by comparing restored stream reaches to nearby unrestored reaches. The reduced channel dimensions led to higher flow velocities, which, through interaction with meandering, triggered a higher variability in flow and depth. Combined with enlargement of the floodplain, this promoted flooding in stream valleys and created wider environmental gradients. Plant diversity strongly increased in the floodplain area, the land–water interface and the shallow water habitat at the channel margins, but decreased in the central parts of stream channels. There, higher flow velocities led to more typically lotic (running water) in-stream plant communities, indicated by a sharp decrease in floating-leaved species and an increase in trailing species. Riparian vegetation showed a higher beta-diversity across the wider valley slopes of restored reaches, with more wetland species in areas with water-tables between 0.0 and −0.6 m, and more upland species as well. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that the combination of strongly reduced channel dimensions, remeandering and widening of riparian zones, is effective in restoring in-stream and riparian habitat heterogeneity. The restoration efforts lead to distinct immediate increases in total and beta-diversity of many typical stream and riparian plant species. Overall, this stresses the importance of applying restoration measures to both streams and stream valleys simultaneously, considering them as a single landscape unit. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - During recent years power systems are operated near the nominal capacity of system equipment with low stability margin. Operation of power systems in this condition is extremely risky and power systems lose their stability with any intense failure of system equipment. In bulk power system, it is more critical and may cause a partial or overall blackout. The capability of black start to bring back system to a normal condition in the case of partial or overall shut down is very important in each power system. When a shutdown occurs, power plants with black start capability supply cranking power for non-black start power plants, pick up critical loads and energize required transmission lines. These actions should be done in minimum time interval to maximize system provided energy during the restoration process. Most important decision making during restoration process is the determination of start-up sequence of generation units. During the restoration process, units with black start capability (BS units) start at the beginning of the process to provide cranking power for non-black start units (NBS units). Hence the determination of NBS units is decision variable in the restoration problem. In this paper, this problem has been described as a bi-level optimization problem which in upper level determines the optimal start-up sequence of NBS units by using a Teaching-Learning Based Optimization algorithm and in lower level determines the optimal transmission path with minimum number of switching and maximum reliability between any two necessary buses using the searching path graph-based algorithm. The proposed approach has been implemented successfully on IEEE 24-bus RTS and IEEE 118-bus test systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Repair and restoration is an important step in remanufacturing as it ensures that end-of-life products are returned to as-new condition before entering their subsequent life cycle. Currently, repair and restoration processes are carried out manually by skilled workers. The advent of the additive manufacturing (AM) technology has led researchers to seek its potential in automating repair and restoration as a more effective method in remanufacturing. However, the application of this widespread technology in remanufacturing is still new. This paper provides an overview on the principles and capabilities of the existing AM technology. The potential of Direct Energy Deposition technology for repair and restoration of remanufacturable components are discussed along with issues and challenges that need to be addressed since the components need to be returned to as in new condition or at least matching the original specification. This paper proposed the development of design guidelines for restoration of remanufacturable products using AM in order to support life cycle thinking in the development of environmentally sustainable products. The use of AM as the future technology for automated repair and restoration is in-line with the current Industrial Revolution 4.0. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - This study evaluates the potential for pasture improvement and restoration at two silvopastoral sites. We used a total of 16 wild legume species under different management systems (rhizobial inoculation, mycorrhizal inoculation, sheep penning, and sheep penning with mycorrhizal inoculation), at two mountain sites in Sierra Nevada Natural Park (Granada, southern Spain). The first site, Soportújar, had higher soil fertility and rainfall than the second, Lanjarón. Forage yields in Soportújar ranged from 265 to 8970 kg DM ha−1, Vicia amphicarpa, Vicia monantha, Vicia disperma and Lathyrus clymenum being the most productive species. Mycorrhizal inoculation resulted in higher forage yields for Lens nigricans, V. disperma and Vicia lutea. Seed yields were low, ranging from 5.9 to 1234 kg ha−1. Forage yields in Lanjarón were lower, ranging from 46 to 1415 kg DM ha−1; and the most productive species were V. monantha, V. disperma, Lathyrus cicera and Medicago rigidula. Sheep penning alone and together with mycorrhizal treatment resulted in greater forage yields for most of the species studied, although differences were only significant for V. disperma, V. monantha and Lathyrus sphaericus. Seed yields ranged from 0.4 to 60 kg ha−1. In conclusion, we recommend V. monantha, V. disperma and L. cicera followed by V. amphicarpa and L. clymenum (in wetter more fertile sites) and M. rigidula (in drier sites), as they seem to be the best adapted to the pedoclimatic conditions of Sierra Nevada Natural Park. Increasing nutrients in the soil (by sheep penning) and promoting nutrient assimilation (by mycorrhizal inoculation) may be effective strategies for increasing pasture biomass in silvopastoral sites. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Emergent plant pathogens represent one of the most significant threats to biodiversity, and exotic Phytophthora species have recently emerged as a serious problem in restored habitats in California and in nurseries producing the plant stock. It is hypothesized that ‘best management practices’ prescribed through a Phytophthora Prevention Programme (PPP) could be useful in minimizing phytophthora disease incidence. To understand the magnitude of the problem and the efficacy of the PPP, plants in restoration nurseries were evaluated for (i) the Phytophthora species assemblage present in the absence of the PPP, and (ii) the effectiveness of the PPP to reduce them. Sampling included 203 plants grown in the absence of the PPP, and 294 grown implementing the PPP. Only samples collected in the absence of the PPP were Phytophthora-positive, and cumulatively yielded 55 isolates from 13 different taxa, including 1 putative interspecific hybrid genotype. There were 21 novel Phytophthora–plant species combinations. The most common Phytophthora species was P. cactorum. Four plant species had the highest disease incidence, namely: Diplacus aurantiacus (50 ± 11.2%), Heteromeles arbutifolia (33 ± 9.6%), Ceanothus thyrsiflorus (30 ± 8.4%), and Frangula californica (30 ± 8.4%). Disease incidence in nurseries after the implementation of the PPP dropped to zero (P < 0.001), and was unaffected to any significant degree by nursery differences, or plant species tested. This study identifies a large number of novel ‘plant species × Phytophthora species’ combinations, and provides for the first time strong evidence that the PPP significantly reduced Phytophthora in plant stock for habitat restoration. © 2018 British Society for Plant Pathology

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a novel multifunctional composite with nanoparticles of silver (NAg), 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) and nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP); and (2) investigate biofilm-inhibition via the multifunctional nanocomposite against three species of periodontal pathogens for the first time. Methods: The multifunctional nanocomposite was fabricated by incorporating NAg, MPC, DMAHDM and NACP into the resin consisting of pyromellitic glycerol dimethacrylate (PMDGDM) and ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate (EBPADMA). Three species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum) were tested for metabolic activity (MTT), live/dead staining, polysaccharide production and colony-forming units (CFU) of biofilms grown on resins. Results: Incorporation of 0.08% to 0.12% NAg, 3% MPC, 3% DMAHDM and 30% NACP did not compromise the mechanical properties of the composite (p > 0.1). The multifunctional nanocomposite reduced protein adsorption to nearly 1/10 of that of a commercial control (p < 0.05). For all three species, the biofilm CFU was reduced by about 5 and 1 orders of magnitude via the nanocomposite containing NAg + MPC + DMAHDM, compared to commercial control and the composite with MPC + DMAHDM, respectively. Conclusions: The novel multifunctional nanocomposite achieved the greatest reduction in metabolic activity, polysaccharide and biofilm growth of three periodontal pathogens. Clinical significance: The strongly-antibacterial, multifunctional composite is promising for treating root lesions, alleviating periodontitis and protecting the periodontal tissues. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Power system operators are facing major challenges today to keep the system operating at the admissible limits. Recent blackouts demonstrated the need for a systematic study and design of a comprehensive system control strategy. Intentional controlled islanding (ICI) has been proposed as an effective corrective control action of final resort to save the system from a partial or a complete blackout. ICI limits the occurrence and consequences of blackouts by splitting the power system into a group of smaller, stable, and sustainable subsystems, also called islands. After a controlled system separation, power system operators should resynchronize and reconnect each island to restore the system. In this sense, real-time knowledge of the operating condition of the islands is required. In this paper, a real-time ICI and restoration scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme consists of an ICI algorithm that finds islanding solutions with minimal power-flow disruption while considering power system restoration constraints (e.g., blackstart availability, sufficient generation capacity, and observability), a real-time state estimator that monitors the system before and after the islanding, and a restoration process. The proposed ICI and restoration scheme is tested using the dynamic IEEE 39- and 118-bus test systems. © 1969-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The Yangtze estuary is considered as an important eco-region of China, but it has been heavily disturbed by reclamation projects. We evaluated the effect of freshwater inflow on the self-restoration of macrobenthic diversity in 3-year-old vegetated, gravel, and mudflat habitats of reclaimed seaward intertidal wetlands. There was a significant self-restoration of species richness and diversity in vegetated and gravel habitats with no inflow of freshwater, but there were no significant changes in species diversity in three habitats subjected to freshwater inflow. Significant changes in community structures of macrobenthos occurred in vegetated and gravel habitats from pre- to post-restoration. Analysis of benthic health showed that gravel habitats were under moderate to high levels of disturbance in pre-restoration period. In contrast, there tended to be no evidence of disturbance in vegetated and mudflat habitats during two investigations. Restoration of macrobenthos is best achieved in vegetated habitats with on inflow of freshwater. © 2018

AB  - Restoration of river–wetland systems to recover lost ecosystem services and restore consistent flood regimes is commonly directed at modifying in-channel storage and hyporheic exchange. Here, we monitored the hydrologic response to channel realignment in a montane river–wetland system by comparing pre- and post-restoration measurements. In 2015, an earthen berm and 190 m segment of the Upper Colorado River were constructed to consolidate flow from multiple channels into the historic thalweg. We injected a sodium chloride tracer during baseflow and used mass-balance calculations and electrical resistivity imaging to assess changes in near-channel hyporheic exchange. Results indicate a decrease in hyporheic exchange within the wetland due to lost complexity along the consolidated flow path. Subsurface complexity appears to control hyporheic exchange more than surface complexity. Flow consolidation increased the area-adjusted wetland water yield by 231 mm, indicating a loss of wetland water storage capacity. One year of post-restoration monitoring suggests that the form-based channel restoration directed at consolidating flow into a single thread adversely affected the hyporheic exchange functioning in the pre-restoration system. Results from this case study are applicable to restoration planners as they consider the effects of form-based projects on water storage capacity in similar systems. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Soil water is a key variable for re-vegetation and environmental restoration in water-limited terrestrial ecosystems such as the Chinese Loess Plateau. Large land restoration projects (e.g., the “Grain for Green” launched in 1999 and the “Gully Land Consolidation” launched in 2011) had substantial impacts on the storage, distribution, and spatial patterns of soil water, and these factors remain poorly understood across watershed scales. We measured the amount of water stored in soil layers from the surface down to 5 m depth and characterized the vertical distribution of gravimetric soil water content (SWC) among four land uses (cropland, shrubland, forestland, and orchard), two slope aspects (shady vs. sunny), and two landforms (slope vs. gully) in three watersheds on the Chinese Loess Plateau. All three of the watersheds were affected by Grain for Green project, two were affected by the Gully Land Consolidation project (named NG and GT-T watersheds) and one was unaffected by restoration efforts (named GT-U watershed). In the three watersheds, the slope and gully SWCs varied from 2.4 to 24.2% and from 4.8 to 46.6%, respectively, during the sampling period in October 2015 (end of the rainy season). The amount and vertical distribution of slope SWC differed significantly among the land uses and between shady and sunny slopes in the three watersheds (p < 0.05). The mean gully SWC (20.4%) was significantly higher than the mean slope SWC (8.7%) for each of the three watersheds (p < 0.01). Gullies filled by the Gully Land Consolidation project had a large capacity to store soil water by increasing the infiltration of precipitation, which accounted for 14.7% and 11.3% of the total annual rainfall in the NG and GT-T watersheds, respectively. Filled gullies can serve as large reservoirs of soil water to relieve the problem of water shortage and can also increase the amount of land available for cultivation to ease deficits in food production. A combination of the Grain for Green project on slopes for soil conservation and the Gully Land Consolidation project in gullies for storing more soil water and increasing farmland area is an effective land restoration strategy on the Chinese Loess Plateau and is helpful for managing water cycles in regions around the world with deep soils. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conifer encroachment in sagebrush ecosystems reduces habitat heterogeneity, niche space, and resource availability, all of which negatively affect many wildlife populations. Sagebrush restoration is recommended as a management action to mitigate conifer encroachment and restore wildlife across millions of hectares in the Great Basin. Despite this recommendation, the effects of conifer encroachment and sagebrush restoration are unknown for most wildlife species. Small nonvolant mammal communities include keystone species, consumers and prey; facilitate energy flow and ecological function; and provide important ecological goods and services. We assessed causal relationships between conifer encroachment and sagebrush restoration (conifer removal and seeding native plants) on small mammal communities over 11 yr using a Before-After-Control–Impact design. Sagebrush habitat supported an additional small mammal species, twice the biomass, and nearly three times higher densities than conifer-encroached habitat. Sagebrush restoration increased shrub cover, decreased tree cover, and density but failed to increase native herbaceous plant density. Restoration caused a large increase in the non-native, invasive annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.). Counter to prediction, small mammal diversity did not increase in response to sagebrush restoration, but restoration maintained small mammal density in the face of ongoing conifer encroachment. Piñon mice (Peromyscus truei), woodland specialists with highest densities in conifer-encroached habitat, were negatively affected by sagebrush restoration. Increasing cheatgrass due to sagebrush restoration may not negatively impact small mammal diversity, provided cheatgrass density and cover do not progress to a monoculture and native vegetation is maintained. The consequences of conifer encroachment, a long-term, slow-acting impact, far outweigh the impacts of sagebrush restoration, a short-term, high-intensity impact, on small mammal diversity. Given the ecological importance of small mammals, maintenance of small mammal density is a desirable outcome for sagebrush restoration. © 2018

AB  - How to restore a painting when physical and chemical alteration of the painted layer has not yet reached a final stage and is partly caused by unknown ageing processes? Can we make a painting look restored without any physical intervention on it? We encountered this problem in the course of conservation treatment of paintings of the famous Serbian Cubistic and Informalist painter Lazar Vozarević. In the period of 2015–2017, the “Lazar Vozarević” Gallery, based in Sremska Mitrovica, carried out a large project of conservation and restoration of Vozarević’s paintings from different periods. The conservation and restoration treatment was successfully carried out on all paintings but one, a painting from his Informal period, entitled “Untitled” (1961). Due to its physical deterioration, the painting could not be successfully restored using conventional well-established methods. We came to a decision to propose a virtual restoration treatment which would be conducted in a mixed reality environment. In strictly controlled light condition, an exact virtual retouch would be projected onto the canvas, so that the result would be a unique installation, which would emphasize and unify both the original painting and its virtual counterpart. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Regarded as an iconic symbol of modern architecture in Sao Paulo - Brazil, the Copan Building is a meaningful example. On recent years this building started to show some quality unconformities due to its age and deterioration of construction materials. The building’s massive façades are mainly covered by white and gray mosaic tiles, partially including the remarkable brises-soleil. Due to their large extension and lack of conservation plans, the façades had not received preventive maintenance and cleaning care for decades. Over the last few years, pathological signs showed up, like peeling of the ceramic tiling due to the lack of movement joints and deterioration of the plaster mortar, amongst other factors This study presents the applied methods for documentation of building construction data, such as materials and construction techniques, original and restoration projects, aiming to develop a continuous and systematic process of organization and knowledge production. © 2019, RILEM.

AB  - Underwater image restoration is still a challenging task until now, because underwater images are degenerated due to the complex underwater imaging environment and poor light condition. The image degeneration includes color distortion, low contrast, and blur. In this paper, we propose Underwater-GAN, a conditional generative adversarial network for underwater image restoration. In Underwater-GAN, we use Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty term as the backbone network. We design the loss function as the sum of the loss of generative adversarial network and the perceptual loss. In the discriminator of Underwater-GAN, we use a convolution patchGAN classifier to learn a structural loss instead of the image-level loss or pixel-wise loss. Moreover, we construct an underwater image dataset by simulating to generate underwater images according to the underwater imaging model. We train our model with these simulated underwater dataset. The results of our experiments show that the proposed method produces better visual qualitative and quantitative indicators than existing methods. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this article, we describe ecological recovery efforts–restoration–as a crucial component of strategic delta planning. We present restoration as a design process at once biogeophysical and territorial that entails socioecological uncertainties. Adaptive management is an approach to dealing with uncertainties through active monitoring and recalibration of actions taken. We have developed a ‘socioecological monitoring’ program that uses existing biophysical monitoring protocols to collect data on human use. Beyond provisioning demographic and use data, this program also helps to change the relationship between the monitors and managers involved in adaptive management and diverse non-scientific publics, who have thus far been removed from the process. Our approach highlights the importance of user experiences and affective labor to bring people into the design of restoration areas, both as actors to be managed for, as well as agents whose values and desires can help guide landscape evolution. © 2019, © 2019 Newcastle University.

AB  - The existing microgrid-based distribution system restoration methods follow traditional restoration criteria, which achieve a maximum coverage of distribution systems. In extreme conditions (e.g., natural disasters and physical and cyber attacks), the traditional restoration plans could pose additional financial and security risks to local utility customers. That is, restored services could be further interrupted by subsequent outages in the extended event. To address such resilience challenges, this paper proposes the formation of adaptive multimicrogrids as part of the critical service restoration strategy. The proposed strategy comprises microgrid formation (MF) and load switching sequence (LSS) steps. The MF forms multiple microgrids with minimum overall scale and radial or looped topologies and includes optimally positioned mobile emergency resources to address potential risks in extreme conditions. The LSS determines a proper load switching sequence for ensuring the system dynamic performance in the restoration process. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by a case study on the IEEE 132-node test feeder system and the time-domain simulation in MATLAB Simulink. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Background: After root canal treatment, a choice is made between different coronal restorations which in the long run could affect the survival of the tooth. Objective: To compare demographic characteristics between individuals choosing an indirect coronal restoration (crown, inlay/onlay) and individuals choosing other restorations after completion of a root filling. Methods: The cohort consisted of all root-filled upper first molars that were reported to the tax-funded Swedish Social Insurance Agency (SSIA) during 2009. After registration of the root filling, any subsequent coronal restorations within 2 years were identified. The crown group consisted of individuals registered with an indirect coronal restoration and the restoration group was the remaining individuals with a direct coronal restoration or lacking registration. Demographic data (gender, disposable income, age, educational level, civil status and country of birth) were received from Statistics Sweden or the SSIA. Statistical analyses included chi-square test, t test and logistic regression analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: An indirect coronal restoration was received by 7806 individuals (21.9%), and 27 886 individuals (78.1%) received a direct restoration. All demographic variables except gender differed significantly between groups. Logistic regression analysis found significant associations for all demographic variables and the registration of an indirect restoration except for country of birth and gender. Conclusions: The identified demographic differences between individuals choosing to restore their newly root-filled teeth with an indirect restoration compared to those receiving other restorations may indicate that the tax-funded Swedish dental insurance fails to provide dental care on equal terms for Swedish citizens. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Northern coastal zone of Egypt hosts lakes with distinguished characteristics. Earlier, certain coastal lakes were acknowledged as nature reserve, with their rich aquatic environment as well as playing a hosting role to migratory birds. However, maintained conditions with ever-expanding development activities are a challenge. This chapter addresses aspects in the changing structure of coastal lakes; governing factors responsible for the declining dynamic system. Hence, challenges with sustainability and capacity to recover are discussed. As remote sensing techniques proved cost-effective tool, with reasonable accuracy, for monitoring temporal and spatial changes, an application is presented to a case study of the deltaic coastal lake, Lake Burullus. Among the wide information that can be derived from satellite imageries, water quality index is selected as a key indicator to gain insight into evolving environmental state of the coastal lake. Finally, the chapter discusses proposed strategies to regain efficient functionality and sustainable beneficial uses of coastal lakes, while considering applicability. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Objective: Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD), frequently occurring in infancy and childhood, is a major cause of mortality and severe neurologic impairment. This study was performed to examine the effect of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on HIBD in a neonatal rabbit model. Materials and Methods: Uterine artery occlusion was used to establish HIBD models in neonatal rabbits, which were then subjected to sham operation, dimethyl sulfoxide (2 mL) or LY294002 (inhibitor of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, 6.4 μg/kg). Behavioral neurological assessment was performed in neonatal rabbits delivered by cesarean section, after which serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) level and cerebral water content were determined. The level of cleaved caspase-3 level and apoptosis of neurons were observed by immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Furthermore, the expression of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway- and apoptosis-related factors was examined. Results: In neonatal rabbits, HIBD increased the fetal death rate; reduced neurological scores of posture, righting reflex, and deglutition reflex; elevated serum NSE levels, cerebral water content, cleaved caspase-3-positive expression in hippocampal CA1 region and apoptotic neurons; inactivated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as well as reduced Bcl-2 expression and increased BAD and Bax expression. Notably, the treatment of LY294002 further aggravated neurological impairment in neonatal rabbits in response to HIBD. Conclusion: Following the HIBD caused by intrauterine asphyxia, the LY294002 administered through auricular vein infusion into pregnant rabbits exacerbates neurological impairment of neonatal rabbits, suggesting that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may serve as a candidate therapeutic target for neurological recovery. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the VOR gain after intratympanic gentamicin therapy and to correlate them with the mid-term effects on the control of vertigo, in a population of Menière's disease patients. STUDY DESIGN: The study design was a prospective "Outcomes research." SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: This study included 20 patients with unilateral Menière's disease refractory to medical therapy for at least 1 year, and treated with an on demand intratympanic gentamicin protocol. INTERVENTION: Therapeutic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Audiometry, caloric testing, and a vHIT before beginning the protocol were performed. Patients underwent weekly vHIT assessments until a significant gain reduction was observed. Subsequently we performed vHIT tests 1 month after the therapy completion, and then every 3 months for at least 1 year. RESULTS: Complete vertigo control (class A) was achieved in 14 patients at the 12-month follow-up assessment. We observed a significant reduction in VOR gain values at the 3-week follow-up assessment. We found a significant correlation between the 1-month posttreatment ipsilateral hVOR gain and the rate of vertigo recurrence after the first IT gentamicin treatment (p = 0.012; r = 0.400). At the mid-term assessment, 10 patients exhibited a significant partial recovery of the hVOR gain. CONCLUSIONS: The delayed effect of intratympanic gentamicin and the subsequent gain restoration are factors that may influence the patients' outcome. The feasibility of the vHIT system makes it a useful tool to monitorize the VOR changes.

AB  - As part of the project management of the Auvergne rail restoration plan carried out by the Société d'études techniques et économiques (SETEC) on behalf of the French Rail Network (SNCFR, Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Réseau), Diadès was responsible for the diagnosis evaluation of four wrought-iron nineteenth-century viaducts located on the Lavaufranche-Saint-Germain des Fossés line. Once the viaducts' archived documents had been analysed, a complete diagnostic and investigative programme was carried out, including taking dimensional measurements and samples, conducting detailed inspections, anti-corrosion diagnosis, spectrocolorimetry analysis of the gathered data and recalculation of the fatigue of the structures. These results were then used to create a procedure for the restoration and painting of two viaducts while addressing the problem of the presence of lead in the original paintwork. The works were carried out on the Rouzat Viaduct by Lassarat, managed by Diadès. © 2018 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Signal Processing and Networking, WiSPNET.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to high levels of glucose and fatty acid (FFA) can induce tissue damage commonly referred to as glucolipotoxicity and is particularly harmful to pancreatic β-cells. Glucolipotoxicity-mediated β-cell failure is a critical causal factor in the late stages of diabetes, which suggests that mechanisms that prevent or reverse β-cell death may play a critical role in the treatment of the disease. Transcription factor PDX1 was recently reported to play a key role in maintaining β-cell function and survival, and glucolipotoxicity can activate mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), which, in turn, stimulates PDX1 degradation and causes dysfunction and apoptosis of β-cells. Interestingly, previous research has demonstrated that increased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signalling effectively protects β cells from glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Unfortunately, few studies have examined the related mechanism in detail, especially the role in Mst1 and PDX1 regulation. In the present study, we investigate the toxic effect of high glucose and FFA levels on rat pancreatic RINm5F β-cells and demonstrate that the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide restores the expression of PDX1 by inactivating Mst1, thus ameliorating β-cell impairments. In addition, liraglutide also upregulates mitophagy, which may help restore mitochondrial function and protect β-cells from oxidative stress damage. Our study suggests that liraglutide may serve as a potential agent for developing new therapies to reduce glucolipotoxicity. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Bleaching may affect the bond strength of existing composite fillings and may weaken it. Hence, the aim of this study was to find the best method of in-office bleaching with the least effect on microshear bond strength (MSBS) of existing composite resin fillings to tooth structure. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, Class V cavities were prepared on buccal surface of 50 extracted third human sound molars. The cavities in 25 teeth had enamel axial walls, Group E, which were divided into five subgroups of E1 through E5 and in 25 teeth had dentin axial walls, Group D, which were divided into five subgroups of D1 through D5. Cavities were treated with Single Bond 2 adhesive system and restored with composite resin (Z250). The corresponding subgroups received similar bleaching methods and materials; 1-not bleached, 2-hydrogen peroxide (HP) 25%, 3-HP + ultraviolet light, 4-HP + light-emitting diode-curing device, and 5-HP + diode laser. Teeth colors were monitored before and after bleaching, and MSBS test and failure modes were examined. Results were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: One-way ANOVA did not show differences in MSBS of enamel subgroups but showed significant differences in dentin subgroups (P < 0.00). Adhesive fracture in all of the subgroups was the most frequent mode of failure. Kruskal-Wallis test showed that laser was the most effective instrument to change ΔE. Conclusion: Diode laser was the best method for tooth bleaching because lowering the shear bond strength between composite resin and enamel was minimum and also had the most ΔE in tooth bleaching. © 2019 Dental Research Journal.

AB  - Coral nursery and outplanting practices have grown in popularity worldwide for targeted restoration of degraded “high value” reef sites, and recovery of threatened taxa. Success of these practices is commonly gauged from coral propagule growth and survival, which fundamentally determines the return-on-effort (RRE) critical to the cost-effectiveness and viability of restoration programs. In many cases, RRE has been optimized from past successes and failures, which therefore presents a major challenge for locations such as the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) where no local history of restoration exists to guide best practice. In establishing the first multi-taxa coral nursery on the GBR (Opal Reef, February 2018), we constructed a novel scoring criterion from concurrent measurements of growth and survivorship to guide our relative RRE, including nursery propagule numbers (stock density). We initially retrieved RRE scores from a database of global restoration efforts to date (n = 246; 52 studies) to evaluate whether and how success commonly varied among coral taxa. We then retrieved RRE scores for Opal Reef using initial growth and survivorship data for six key coral taxa, to demonstrate that RRE scores were high for all taxa predominantly via high survivorship over winter. Repeated RRE scoring in summer is therefore needed to capture the full dynamic range of success where seasonal factors regulating growth versus survivorship differ. We discuss how RRE scoring can be easily adopted across restoration practices globally to standardize and benchmark success, but also as a tool to aid decision-making in optimizing future propagation (and outplanting) efforts. © 2018 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Target images of range-gated imaging in adverse turbid environments still suffer from the degradation of inhomogeneous turbid medium over the laser transmission path. Based on longitudinal laser tomography, a novel image restoration method is proposed to remove the interferences of the inhomogeneous turbid medium from the degraded target images. The degradation caused by the turbid medium is approximately estimated, assisted by some prior system parameters and the backscattering images of the turbid medium, which can further be used for removal of the interferences of the turbid medium through a proper total variation model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed image restoration method can effectively eliminate the interferences of inhomogeneous turbid medium and achieve exactly the reflectivity distribution for the target behind the turbid medium layer. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of complete restoration of respiratory muscle function in subjects with spinal cord injury. Methods This was an interventional study investigating three subjects maintained on a diaphragm pacing system who were implanted with the spinal cord stimulation system to restore cough. Peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation were the primary physiologic outcome measures; an assessment of the degree of difficulty in raising secretions was the primary clinical outcome measure. Results Mean peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation during spontaneous efforts were 1.7 ± 0.2 L/s and 31 ± 7 cmH2O, respectively. When spinal cord stimulation was applied after pacing volume associated with the subject's maximum inspiratory effort and synchronized with the subject's maximum expiratory effort, peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation were 9.0 ± 1.9 L/s and 90 ± 6 cmH2O, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, each subject experienced much greater ease in raising secretions and marked improvement in the ease in raising secretions compared with other methods. Conclusions Complete restoration of respiratory muscle function can be safely and effectively achieved in the same individuals with spinal cord injury. Spinal cord stimulation results in peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation characteristic of a normal cough, whereas diaphragm pacing was successful in maintaining patients off mechanical ventilation. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - The dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) can compensate the load voltage by injecting a series voltage in the distribution line. However, the conventional compensating methods only focus on the load voltage and the DVR itself. The power factor correction (PFC) at the source side has seldom been considered. This paper aims at correcting the power factor (PF) at the source side using an elliptical restoration based voltage compensating method via the single-phase dynamic voltage restorer (DVR). Specifically, the virtual impedance is used to describe the active and reactive components of the DVR injected voltage. The active and reactive voltage components and a centrifugal angle are utilized to formulate an elliptical compensation trajectory. When the centrifugal angle changes from 0° to 90° the injected voltage will follow the elliptical compensation trajectory. Thus a smooth changeover of the DVR injected voltage can be achieved during the load switching. The source voltage will be in phase with the load current with the proper control of the DVR injected voltage. It means that the PFC at the source side can be achieved using the proposed compensating method. A laboratorial prototype of the single-phase DVR is utilized to validate the proposed control method. The experimental results verify that a unity PF can be maintained at the source side with seamless state transition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Statement of problem: The decision to splint or to restore independently generally occurs during the planning stage, when the advantages and disadvantages of each clinical situation are considered based on the proposed treatment. However, clinical evidence to help clinicians make this decision is lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the marginal bone loss, implant survival rate, and prosthetic complications of splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations. Material and methods: This study was designed according to the Cochrane criteria for elaborating a systematic review and meta-analysis and adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Also, this review was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42017080162). An electronic search in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases was conducted up to November 2017. A specific clinical question was structured according to the population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) approach. The addressed focused question was “Should the restoration of adjacent implants be splinted or nonsplinted?” The meta-analysis was based on the Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance methods to assess the marginal bone loss, implant survival, and prosthetic complications of splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations. Results: Nineteen studies were selected for qualitative and quantitative analyses. A total of 4215 implants were placed in 2185 patients (splinted, 2768; nonsplinted, 1447); the mean follow-up was 87.8 months (range=12-264 months). Quantitative analysis found no significant differences between splinted and nonsplinted restorations for marginal bone loss. The assessed studies reported that 75 implants failed (3.4%), of which 24 were splinted (99.1% of survival rate) and 51 were nonsplinted (96.5% of survival rate). Quantitative analysis of all studies showed statistically significant higher survival rates for splinted restorations than for nonsplinted restorations. Ceramic chipping, screw loosening, abutment screw breakage, and soft tissue inflammation were reported in the selected studies. The quantitative analysis found no statistically significant difference in the prosthetic complications of splinted and nonsplinted restorations. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this systematic review and meta-analysis, it was concluded that there was no difference in the marginal bone loss and prosthetic complications of splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations; this is especially true for restorations in the posterior region. However, splinted restorations were associated with decreased implant failure. © 2018 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe a quality assurance issue, that is, the production of nondiagnostic high-contrast radiographs when imaging teeth restored with all-zirconia crowns on bitewing radiographs. Study Design: All-zirconia crowns were imaged with DIGORA Optime photostimulable phosphor (PSP) plates (Soredex/Orion Corp., Helsinki, Finland). To assess the differences in software processing, the PSP plates were scanned into third-party software as well as directly into the twain and native software provided by the manufacturer. Gamma correction, histogram stretch, and scanner resolution settings were adjusted. Vertical bitewings were acquired to increase anatomic coverage. Results: Scanning into third-party software or directly into the twain and native software did not improve contrast. Shifting the lower limit of the histogram stretch to 3 with a gamma correction of 2 resolved the problem. Neither scanner resolution setting nor vertical bitewings improved contrast. Conclusions: The nondiagnostic high-contrast radiographs result from imaging software not effectively displaying the available gray scale. The software processing error appears to be initiated by the high-attenuation characteristics of zirconia. Consequently, radiographs with a high ratio of zirconia crown to normal anatomy are particularly susceptible. © 2019

AB  - Purpose: To test the validity and reliability of a newly developed Implant Restoration Esthetic Index (IREI) and to compare esthetic outcomes reported by patients and professionals. Materials and Methods: Ten graduate students and 10 prosthodontists assessed esthetic outcomes of 27 single-tooth implants with the IREI. Six peri-implant soft tissue parameters were measured using visual analog scales: mesial papilla presence, distal papilla presence, gingival trigone, soft tissue curvature, alveolar process deficiency, and soft tissue color and texture, as well as the six crown parameters: crown contour, crown position, crown labial convexity, crown characterization, crown color and translucency, and abutment visibility. The validity was tested based on Pearson's correlation. The internal consistency reliability was analyzed by Cronbach's alpha. Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to express the test-retest reliability and the inter-rater reliability. The correlations between patient and professional evaluations were analyzed by Pearson's correlation. Results: The IREI demonstrated significant correlation (p < 0.05) to the pink esthetic score and white esthetic score (PES/WES). The internal consistency reliability showed a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.830. The test-retest reliability was excellent in both the graduate student group and the prosthodontist group, with ICCs of 0.961 and 0.952, respectively (p < 0.05). The inter-rater reliability was acceptable, with ICCs of 0.649 and 0.667, respectively (p < 0.05). Low correlation coefficients were found between patient and professional evaluations. Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that the IREI was considered a valid and reliable index involving sufficient parameters for professional esthetic evaluation of single-tooth implant restorations. The patient-reported esthetic outcomes had poor or no significant correlation to professional-reported outcomes. © 2017 by the American College of Prosthodontists

AB  - Seed introduction is a current practice for the conservation and restoration of plant populations and communities. In many cases, however, seeds of target wild species must be collected from natural populations and then stored in proper conditions until re-introduction. Peatland pool margin specialists rarely recolonize their habitat once a peatland is restored following peat extraction and therefore must be actively reintroduced. However, little is known about the storage conditions promoting seed viability. In this context, we investigated the effects of four storage conditions on the seed viability of eight species collected from natural peatland pool margins of eastern Canada: 1) room temperature, dry conditions, 2) cold temperature, dry conditions, 3) cold temperature, moist conditions, and 4) cold temperature, submerged. Seeds stored for one year were periodically (3, 6, 12 months) tested for viability using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Seed viability decreased after storage for four of the eight species investigated (Carex echinata, C. magellanica, C. oligosperma, and C. pauciflora) and increased for Rhynchospora alba, but did not vary significantly following storage for C. limosa and Scheuchzeria palustris. Furthermore, the viability of Drosera intermedia and Rhynchospora alba seeds was higher when stored in dry conditions relative to moist or submerged conditions. Proper seed storage conditions are thus highly species-dependent. Direct sowing after collection should be preferred for most of the Carex species, while seeds of Scheuchzeria palustris, Drosera intermedia and Rhynchospora alba could be stored, preferably in dry conditions, without impacting introduction success due to reduced seed viability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Inherited retinal disease (IRD) affects about 1 in 3000 to 1 in 5000 individuals and is now believed to be the most common cause of blindness registration in developed countries. Until recently, the management of such conditions had been exclusively supportive. However, advances in molecular biology and medical engineering have now seen the rise of a variety of approaches to restore vision in patients with IRDs. Optogenetic approaches are primarily aimed at rendering secondary and tertiary neurons of the retina light-sensitive in order to replace degenerate or dysfunctional photoreceptors. Such approaches are attractive because they provide a “causative gene-independent” strategy, which may prove suitable for a variety of patients with IRD. We discuss theoretical and practical considerations in the selection of optogenetic molecules, vectors, surgical approaches and review previous trials of optogenetics for vision restoration. Optogenetic approaches to vision restoration have yielded promising results in pre-clinical trials and a phase I/II clinical trial is currently underway (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02556736). Despite the significant inroads made in recent years, the ideal optogenetic molecule, vector and surgical approach have yet to be established. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the current status of advanced cartilage restoration procedures among newly trained orthopaedic surgeons in the United States. Methods: The American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery database was queried to identify all advanced cartilage restoration procedure cases submitted by American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery part II board certification examination candidates from 2003 to 2015. All documented autologous chondrocyte implantation, autologous osteochondral transfer, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and marrow stimulation techniques (MSTs) procedures were analyzed. Analysis was performed to describe trends in annual incidence, types of complications, concomitant procedures, and geographical differences in incidence of advanced cartilage procedures. Results: From 2003 to 2015, a total of 2,827 surgeons submitted 7,522 cartilage restoration procedures, with 7,060 cases documented as MST (80.01%). The number of cartilage cases decreased significantly from 2003 to in 2015 (P < .001), with MST having the largest decline (P < .001). The incidence of open osteochondral allograft transplantation (odds ratio = 1.35; P = .023) and open autologous osteochondral transfer (odds ratio = 0.84; P = .004) increased over the study period. Overall, the majority of patients (57.0%) were male; however, female patients were on average significantly older than male patients (P < .001). Cartilage procedures were performed concomitantly with a realignment osteotomy procedure in 1.7% of cases. The incidence of surgical complications increased throughout the study period from 2.9% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2015 (P < .001). Conclusions: Cartilage restoration procedures, specifically MSTs, are being decreasingly performed among recently trained orthopaedic surgeons. In contrast, complication rates have been increasing since 2003, demonstrating a possible paradigm shift toward more complex cartilage procedures, specifically osteochondral grafting procedures. Clinical Relevance: This study demonstrates a significant decline in the use of MSTs by recently trained orthopaedic surgeons. In addition, an increase in several more complex cartilage restoration procedures was found. Taken in sum, these changes may reflect a shift in residency and fellowship training away from marrow stimulation procedures that elicit a fibrocartilage reparative tissue and toward more complex procedures that provide a more hyaline-like articular cartilage surface. © 2019 Arthroscopy Association of North America

AB  - Purpose: Computed tomography (CT) imaging for three-dimensional (3D) printed models may improve the quality of surgical preoperative plans. Although metal objects can cause artifacts in CT images, integration of CT and digital dental arch imaging may solve this problem. The present study aimed to evaluate effects of the number of metal restorations and mandibular position during CT imaging on accuracy of reproduced models. Methods: Stereolithography datasets from three sets of dental models having different numbers of metal restorations were obtained using a laboratory digitizing device (control) and CT equipment (nonintegrated data). CT scanning was performed under two conditions: intercuspal position (closed) and separated using paraffin wax (open). Nonintegrated data after metal artifact removal were separated into maxillary and mandibular dentition groups. The occlusal part of the control dentition and nonintegrated data were superimposed and integrated (integrated data). The root mean square (RMS) between the control and stereolithography data was calculated and analyzed with three-way analysis of variance and t-test with Bonferroni correction. Results: Increasing numbers of metal restorations resulted in increase in metal artifacts and RMS values. Moreover, the RMS of the closed dataset was significantly greater than that of the open dataset because of the creation of artificial occlusal surfaces. The RMSs of the integrated datasets were significantly smaller than those of the nonintegrated datasets, except for the open model without metal restorations. Conclusions: Accuracies of reproduced maxillary and mandibular models decreased with increasing numbers of metal restorations and in the closed mandibular position during CT scanning. © 2019 Japan Prosthodontic Society

AB  - The impact of ghost fishing in large coastal ecosystems has generated considerable interest. In smaller, understudied systems with fewer stakeholders, derelict fishing gear (DFGs) may have impacts similar to these larger systems at the same relative scale. Four years of side scan sonar surveys in the Mullica River-Great Bay Estuary (New Jersey, USA) supported the recovery of 1776 DFGs off-season by commercial partners. Locations with high densities of recovered DFGs (&gt;200 DFGs/km2) occupied intersections of recreational vessel traffic and commercial crabbing activity. Condition and depth-in-sediment of recovered DFGs was used to evaluate true bycatch (terrapins, whelks, blue crabs) versus species utilizing degraded gear as habitat (juvenile tautog, oyster toadfish). Critically, gear recovered in-season with low cost sonars (an additional 225 DFGs) prevented the accumulation of new DFGs which likely generate the highest percentages of bycatch. Removal of DFGs in this system led to significant ecological (reduced bycatch), economic (&gt;$61,000 in direct pay, reused gear), and anticipated future benefits (increased harvest). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Landscape-scale restoration requires stakeholder collaboration and recognition of diverse social and ecological motivations to achieve multiple benefits. Yet few landscape restoration projects have set and achieved shared social and ecological goals. Mechanisms to integrate social and ecological motivations will differ in different landscapes. We provide examples from urban, agricultural, and mined landscapes to highlight how integration can achieve multiple benefits and help incentivize restoration. Better communication of ecological and especially social benefits of restoration could increase motivation. Social and economic incentives from carbon markets are evident in agricultural landscapes, biodiversity offset schemes are unlikely to motivate restoration without proof-of-concept, and framing restoration in terms of ecosystem services shows promise. Synthesis and applications. When setting restoration goals, it is important to recognize the diverse motivations that influence them. In doing so, and by evaluating both social and ecological benefits, we can better achieve desired restoration outcomes. Customizing incentives to cater for diverse stakeholder motivations could therefore encourage restoration projects. © 2018 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society

AB  - We describe here our progress in developing a rat model for cortically controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES). In these experiments we are using neural activity recorded from motor cortex to drive stimulation of paralyzed muscles in order to restore voluntary motor function following spinal cord injury (SCI). We first evaluated the ability of different cortical interfaces to estimate intended movements and muscle activation, determining whether intracortical interfaces were necessary. We found that spiking activity from intracortical electrodes predicted movements with reasonable accuracy, whereas less invasive epidural electrodes performed considerably worse. We are currently evaluating the utility of these approaches to restore function following SCI as well as their ability to rehabilitate function with repeated training. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - After the pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) was listed as endangered in 1990, a variety of management actions focusing on early life history needs have been implemented to aid species recovery. Given the scarcity of age-0 pallid sturgeon, managers and scientists have relied on sympatric congeners to evaluate the effectiveness of management actions in the short term; however, increased understanding of habitat requirements for age-0 Scaphirhynchus sturgeon is still needed to appropriately focus management efforts. Recently, a lack of food-producing and foraging habitats were proposed as potential limiting factors for pallid sturgeon, and the purpose of this study was to evaluate the current definition of these habitats at multiple spatial scales using data from age-0 Scaphirhynchus sturgeon (shovelnose sturgeon [Scaphirhynchus platyrhynchus] or hybrid [shovelnose sturgeon x pallid sturgeon]). Results showed the water depths and velocities that currently define age-0 pallid sturgeon foraging habitat had little effect on age-0 Scaphirhynchus sturgeon prey consumption. Similar results occurred when evaluating the relationship between prey consumption and food-producing habitat present 10, 20, and 30 days before capture. Assuming that individuals captured during this study were a valid surrogate, these results suggest that increasing foraging and food-producing habitat as defined by the current depth and velocity criteria is unlikely to result in the desired benefits of increased growth and survival of age-0 pallid sturgeon.

AB  - The National Palace of Queluz is a reference of Portuguese Heritage and is listed as National Monument since 1910. Its Gardens extend to around 16 acres and have become a reference in European historical gardens due to their complex and harmonious landscaping. However, over the years, the Palace and the Gardens have been severely damaged by a great fire and various floods. In 2012 the management of the Palace and the Gardens was awarded to Parques de Sintra – Monte da Lua and a global restoration project was started. This paper focus on part of that project: the restoration of a masonry arch bridge over the Jamor River that accesses to the Botanical Garden. This bridge was probably constructed between 1752 and 1790 when a lot of construction work took place in the south part of the Gardens. However due to the cyclic floods and other causes, some repair works were made throughout the years, which included the use of concrete in 1967. In this project it was identified a range of pathologies and some severe structural problems, such as the loss of material in the left abutment as well as a crack that crosses the bridge vertically and horizontally. The intervention strategy, based on the minimal intervention philosophy, was defined by a multidisciplinary team and combines structural operations, that include the strengthening of the left abutment through micro piles and the repair and retrofitting of the arch using carbon fibers, with conservation works on originals mortars, bricklaying and pictorial finishing. © 2019, RILEM.

AB  - This article methodically gathers concepts and findings from related disciplines to propose that there is a fundamental, disorder-specific psychological impairment, which defines Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as etiologically different from simple PTSD. This impairment is a flawed working model for restoration of trust when one partner fears betrayal. This working model is legacy of childhood relationships with manipulative caretakers who kept the child powerless to test the trustworthiness of their reasons to break promises and to fail the child’s expectations. Manipulative caretakers invert the respective roles and responsibilities for restoration of trust, which constitutes perversion of intimacy. This article describes how that fundamental flaw becomes the cause of patients’ disorder, by episodically rendering them powerless to ascertain a perception of grave betrayal as true or false in later relationships. Repeated failure with experiments for certainty about others’ love explains the characteristic personality traits and beliefs of persons with Complex PTSD, i.e., cynicism about the world’s benevolence, self-derogation and sense of a foreshortened future. This article closes with reference to a study that investigated the efficacy of a crisis intervention designed to remediate this fundamental impairment. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In this paper, we test the methods and algorithms for constructing neural network models from equations and data using the example of the problem on the restoration of the Laplace equation solutions according to the measurements in a unit square. We estimate the quality of approximate solutions constructed with the help of neural networks for different sets of system parameters (the number of points in which the operator is calculated, the number of test points on one side of the square). During the experiment, all test points inside the square are regenerated. Selection of the solution is carried out by optimization of the error functional. Optimization is carried out using the algorithm of training neural networks Resilient Propagation (RProp). The algorithms considered can be applied to a wide range of practically interesting problems, since they practically do not depend on the form of the differential equation, its linearity, the geometry of the region, etc. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Wireless sensor-actor networks (WSANs) are a core component of Internet of Things (IOT), and are useful for environments that are difficult and/or dangerous for sensors to be deployed deterministically. After random deployment, the sensors are required to disperse autonomously without central control to maximize the coverage and re-establish the connectivity of the network. In this paper, we propose a Physarum inspired self-healing autonomous network connectivity restoration algorithm that minimize movement overhead and keep load balance. The mechanism to select the alternative nodes only involves the one-hop information table, and depends on actor node location from base station (regions of k-influence), and residual energy. Our model achieved almost complete coverage, and fault repair in one or two rounds with minimal number of movement overhead. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - As a promising alternative to traditional treatment, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is being used to encourage hair growth through the release of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to hair restoration, PRP’s multifactorial capabilities can also be used to treat aging skin, facial scarring, and acne. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the success of PRP in the field of dermatology, with specific attention to the role of PRP in hair restoration. Where possible, meta-analyses were used to evaluate the efficacy of PRP. In androgenetic alopecia (AGA) patients, 3 monthly PRP injections (1 session administered every month for 3 months) exhibited greater efficacy over placebo as measured by change in total hair density (hair/cm2) over the treatment period (mean difference: 25.61, 95% CI: 4.45 to 46.77; P =.02). The studies included in the meta-analysis used a half-head design, which may have influenced the results because of the effects PRP can induce. Controlled studies suggest that 2 to 4 sessions of PRP combined with traditional therapies and procedures can help minimize acne scarring and facial burns, improve aesthetic results, and decrease recovery time. However, data for these indications are lacking and are less robust in design. In conclusion, to achieve an improvement in hair restoration in patients with mild AGA, 3 initial monthly PRP injections should be given. Only upon completion of rigorous, randomized, controlled studies can standardized and effective PRP protocols for treating dermatology conditions such as acne scarring, facial burns, and aging skin be determined. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In south-eastern part of the Sultanate of Oman, PDO is producing from one of Tight Sour Field (with H2S 1-2%) with current reservoir pressures ranging from 40,000 to 60,000kpa for more than 20 yrs. Due to tight nature of reservoir, the wells are hydraulically fracced to produce, but with time the production rates decline and wells start to produce in unstable mode. This unstable production mode leads to huge scaling and corrosion issues which results in tubing failures requiring huge and expensive workover to restore well production. Due to low production rates and expensive workover makes these intervention very less attractive in terms of Net Present Value (NPV) compared to other opportunities. This paper describes the challenges in restoring production from wells with tubing leaks using conventional workover techniques and the advantages of using new approach of using Hydraulic Work over Unit (HWOU/Snubbing unit) to workover these wells. Using HWOU for workover restoration time from the failure to restoring production has been reduced from ~2-3yrs to almost less than a year along with significant reduction in overall cost (more than 40% per well). This approach has been successfully applied to 2 wells till dates and upcoming workover will be done in similar manner. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - Cartilage restoration procedures appear to be increasing in popularity and are being performed more frequently for older patients according to a recent analysis of database data. Chondroplasty and microfracture are most commonly performed; however, chondrocyte transfer procedures, including osteochondral autologous transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation, are being performed more commonly. Relatively few corrective osteotomies are being performed in conjunction with these procedures; this is concerning because surgeons are either not looking for malalignment or not correcting it.

AB  - Peat-forming wetlands, particularly floating fens that form the initial stages of these ecosystems, are declining globally due to excavation, dehydration and eutrophication. Restoration typically involves reestablishment of early-successional open-water stages, with oligotrophic conditions that are characteristic for these systems. However, restoration success is notoriously limited. A potential improvement may be to initiate succession by reintroducing of target plant species. Knowledge is therefore needed on (a) which plant functional groups should be re-introduced to stimulate fen formation; and (b) how to manage nutrient levels during restoration, considering that plant growth may be slow in oligotrophic conditions. We hypothesized that increasing functional diversity of introduced species would stimulate the formation of peat-forming target communities, their biomass accumulation and expansion onto open water. We also hypothesized that nutrient availability would mediate the relative contribution of specific functional groups to these effects. We investigated this in 36 artificial outdoor ponds by manipulating plant functional diversity (clonal dominants, clonal stress-tolerators and interstitials) on constructed rafts with fen-forming communities, and subjected these to a range of nutrient loadings over 2 years. Increasing functional diversity as well as increasing nutrient loadings had stimulating effects on plant biomass accumulation, cover formation and rhizome growth onto open water. Both complementarity (due to niche partitioning or facilitation) and selection effects were mechanisms underlying the diversity effect, with a constant relative importance over the entire range of nutrient availabilities. Different functional groups were important for biomass production at different nutrient availabilities. Rhizome formation by clonal stress-tolerators contributed disproportionately to open water colonization, identifying this functional group as key across all nutrient levels. Synthesis and applications. Restoration of floating fen communities can be stimulated during the first 2 years by introducing a high functional diversity of plant species. These include fast-growing clonal species, clonal stress-tolerators and interstitials, which facilitate each other. Restoration is dependent on the presence of clonal stress-tolerators such as Calla palustris, Comarum palustre and Menyanthes trifoliata for expansion onto the open water. Furthermore, restoration can start under a wide range of water nutrient levels, including eutrophic conditions. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Modern urban systems contain intricate interconnected networks whose components depend on each other to operate, provide value, and sustain a functional society. However, this interconnectedness increases the fragility of these systems by allowing the propagation of disruptions through their interdependencies, which may result in large cascades of failures that can cause severe loss of functionality and recovery capability. Furthermore, the resilience of these systems does not only depend on the individual components, but on their combined ability to recover promptly. With the aim of quantifying the interdependence between these systems, this work introduces a new statistical model for evaluating and simulating the restoration of complex interdependent systems, while modeling their restoration as interdependent processes. The statistical model is introduced along with a custom calibration algorithm that fits the model to observed time series data of infrastructure restoration of functionality. Data from six iconic earthquakes are used to fit and test the model against a suite of service restoration curves associated with different infrastructures. It is concluded that the model may be used to simultaneously estimate the restoration and resilience of an infrastructure system after the disruptions caused by a mainshock. Limitations, possible extensions, and improvements of the model are discussed. © 2018

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism explaining reversion of clinical DAP non-susceptible (NS) MRSA isolates to DAP-susceptible (S) by analysis of genomic and cell wall characteristics of clinical DAP-NS MRSA and DAP-S MRSA isolates as well as in vitro revertant DAP-S MRSA using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and analysis of biological properties. WGS of the 4 clinical DAP-NS MRSA revealed mprF mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions or deletion. These same amino acid substitutions and deletion were also observed in the 4 in vitro revertant DAP-S strains. While WGS identified the presence of the same mprF mutations in both the DAP-NS and in vitro DAP-S revertant strains, new mutations were also detected in other genes and intergenic regions of in vitro DAP-S revertant strains. Transmission electron microscopy to assess cell-wall (CW) thickness of 4 sets strains (pre- and post-DAP therapy isolates and in vitro DAP-S revertant) showed that 3 of the 4 isolates developed increased thickness of the CW after DAP therapy. After reversion to DAP susceptibility, CW thickness was decreased to the same level as DAP-S MRSA. Our results indicate that in vitro conversion of DAP-NS MRSA to DAP-S is independent of mprF gene mutations and may be partially explained by a change in CW thickness. However, as some strains showed no change in the CW, further studies are required to elucidate the different mechanisms of resistance to DAP, and factors for conversion of DAP-NS to DAP-S. © 2018 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases

AB  - Ouro Preto is among the most significant symbolic cities in Brazilian history and culture. The town was declared a National Monument in 1933, protected by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute (Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional – IPHAN) in 1938, and in 1980 it was the first Brazilian city included in UNESCO World Heritage List (Fig.Â 1). The Municipal Theatre of Ouro Preto, which belongs to the architectural and urban complex, is listed by IPHAN and is one of the oldest in operation in the Americas. The aim of this paper is to analyze the restoration works of the Municipal Theatre of Ouro Preto. Firstly, an architectural reading of the theatre was made, examining the materials and building system used in its construction, its surroundings in various periods, the physical, functional and visual relationship with the city, its symbolic meaning and the heritage designation process. Regarding the restoration works, the analysis has considered the causes of deterioration, diagnosis and state of conservation, previous interventions, the restoration project and intervention methods. The conclusions considered the interventions in the light of modern principles of cultural heritage preservation, the importance of the restoration works of the Municipal Theatre of Ouro Preto and its use as a public cultural space for the city.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is an unavoidable degenerative disease of the human body. A relatively efficient and desirable treatment exists that leads to the ecological restoration of cartilage through the adjustments of the micro-environment of the human body and relies on its self-repairing ability. In the present study, lubricants were injected into the knee joints of rats. Hyaluronic acid (HA) reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) provided a lubricating condition for cartilage repair, as well as played an important role in the regulation of the microenvironment in the joint cavity. The experimental results demonstrated that the stability of HA lubricant reinforced with GO was dependent on the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the graphite oxide nano-sheets. The GO could be evenly distributed on the joint surface in the form of a solid lubrication film and was able to decrease the articular cartilage necrosis and the ratio of MMP-3/TIMP-1 through TIMP-1 activity increase. The HA lubricant reinforced with GO demonstrated an apparent antifriction effect on the joint surface, providing a stable environment for cartilage repair. It was also conducive to long-term lubrication improvement. The adjustment of micro-environment between the cartilage friction interfaces might contribute to the treatment of osteoarthritis through ecological restoration.

AB  - Urban rivers play an important role in the sustainable development of cities. With increasing attention being given to the implementation of urban river restoration, a more integral and reliable method to evaluate the ecological effect (restoration effect, i.e., effect of restoration on both biodiversity and ecosystem services) of the restoration practice is needed. To fill this gap, a comprehensive assessment index system, based on the “driving forces-pressures-state-impacts-responses” (DPSIR) model was established to holistically evaluate the overall ecological effect of a polluted urban river (the Nanfei River) during restoration. Our results revealed that the greatest influence on the river ecosystem came from: cultivated areas, gross domestic product, ammonia nitrogen (NH4 +-N) and total phosphorus (TP) emissions from large-scale aquaculture, non-point rainfall runoff, and municipal sectors. In addition, the river restoration implementation positively influenced the polluted urban river ecosystem. During our study period, a trend of parallel increase between biodiversity and ecosystem services was existed, and an approximate positive relationship between ecosystem services and restoration age was found. However, the detailed relationship patterns between biodiversity, ecosystem services and restoration age should be revealed by long-term monitoring. Overall, the method proposed in our study would improve the understanding of restoration practice, and provide guidance for future restoration practice assessment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Graphene, a monolayer sheet of graphite, shows plenty of attractive properties and has been expected to replace conventional materials in various fields. For the industrial application of graphene, a high throughput synthesis method on arbitrary substrates is strongly required. Chemical exfoliation via graphene oxide (GO) is thought to be a suitable method for the high throughput synthesis. However, the crystallinity of reduced GO is unacceptably low. Although we found that the plasma treatment with Cu catalyst yields graphene with high crystallinity from GO on a dielectric substrate, the effect of the growth parameter has been unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of the gas ratio of CH4 and H2 in this process on the crystallinity of graphene. By optimizing the gas ratio, we succeeded in reducing and restoring GO to the extent that its mobility increased to 9.0 × 102 cm2 V-1 s-1. © 2018 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate in vitro the retention and the resistance form, as well as the failure modes of maxillary premolars restored with cast metal crowns and different core materials. Materials and Methods: Sixty human extracted maxillary premolars were selected according to their size and were embedded in PMMA resin blocks. After removing a part of their clinical crowns, the teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups of 20 teeth and were either left unrestored, or they were restored with amalgam or composite resin. All teeth were prepared for a cast metal complete coverage restoration. The restorations were cemented on the prepared teeth with a resin-modified glass ionomer luting agent (GC Fuji Plus). All specimens were subjected to static loading at 1 mm/min by a universal testing machine, until failure. Half the specimens of each group were subjected to tensile loading along the long axis of the teeth. The other half were subjected to compressive loading at a 30° angle. Failure loads and failure modes for each tooth were recorded. The statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's HSD test. Results: One-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences among the 3 tested groups (p < 0.05) for both tests. The group of teeth with no core material presented the highest failure loads for both the tensile and the compressive loading tests, with mean loads of 381.02 Ν and 741.21 Ν, respectively. Mean tensile and compressive failure loads for the amalgam group were 277.34 Ν and 584.75 Ν, while the composite resin group presented the lowest tensile and compressive failure values, which were 250.77 Ν and 465.78 Ν, respectively. The compression loading test resulted in the same failure mode for all specimens, which included unfavorable fracture of the teeth in combination with detachment of the cast metal complete coverage restorations. The tensile loading test resulted in different failure modes between the groups that used a core material and the group with no core material. Conclusions: Teeth that lost more than half of their coronal structure presented better retention and resistance form if no core material was used, provided that a minimum of 2-mm axial wall height was present at the missing part. Teeth that have lost more than half of their coronal structure and were restored with amalgam core presented better retention and resistance form than those restored with composite resin. Catastrophic fractures, extending to the root, were associated with compression forces but not with tensile forces. © 2017 by the American College of Prosthodontists

AB  - We live in a world where lots of manuscripts were written in earlier times. There are lots of historical manuscripts which are in deteriorated form. There is a need to restore these manuscripts in order to preserve our cultural heritage and ancient knowledge for future generation. Our focus is to restore the manuscripts that have been deteriorated because of age. These manuscripts got crushes, turned yellowish and got torn. There are some existing techniques for background restoration, and lot of work has already done in removing the background deterioration but very less work is done on foreground of manuscript for removing the deterioration. Our focus is to restore the foreground of manuscript by completing the incomplete characters in a torn places of manuscript through restoration techniques and for performing the background restoration, we have used in built Otsu binarization thresholding method. We are applying image processing methods for restoring text, foreground and background on deteriorated manuscript images. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the fatigue failure load via staircase approach and stress distribution via FEA of different ceramic configurations arranged in multilayers composed of ceramic materials with different elastic moduli and compare them to monolayer models. Methods: CAD–CAM ceramic blocks were used to shape 0.3 mm and 1.5 mm thick discs, corresponding to: feldspathic (F), 64 GPa; lithium disilicate (L), 95 GPa; and Yttrium-partially stabilized tetragonal zirconia (Y-TZP) (Y), 209.3 GPa. The 0.3 mm discs were arranged in 4 layers cemented with resin cement (Multilink N), and the 1.5 mm discs were not treated, in such a way that the final thickness of all specimens was 1.5 mm (±0.15 mm). The following 6 groups were tested: F (F: monolithic); L (L: monolithic); LLFF (L + L + F + F); FFLL (F + F + L + L); YLFF (Y + L + F + F); YLLF (Y + L + L + F). The loads-to-fracture were obtained using the biaxial flexural strength test until failure and the data were run using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons (α = 0.05) tests. The biaxial bending test was also simulated through finite element analysis (FEA) to identify the tensile stress generated at each layer of the groups. Mean fatigue failure load (100,000 cycles; 20 Hz) was determined using the staircase approach. The fracture analysis was performed by stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy. Results: The load to fracture (N) were obtained as follows: L (592.9 ± 73.8)D &gt; FFLL (319.78 ± 43.59)C &gt; YLLF (246.75 ± 24.89)B &gt; F (167.13 ± 9.84)A &gt; YLFF (166.51 ± 15.24)A &gt; LLFF (165.46 ± 22.75)A; and the fatigue failure load (N): L (310.92 ± 26.73)F &gt; FFLL (190.17 ± 8.32)E &gt; F (106.21 ± 2.81)D &gt; YLLF (96.48 ± 5.73)C &gt; YLFF (89.56 ± 2.38)B &gt; LLFF (77.23 ± 6.33)A. The origin of all of the tested specimens was located at the tensile region of the discs, as encountered in FEA. Significance: The material under tensile stress is determinant for the restoration's strength and the adhesive interface negatively influenced the mechanical behavior of the multilayer structures. © 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials

AB  - Djamaluddin R, Brown B, Lewis III RR. 2019. The practice of hydrological restoration to rehabilitate abandoned shrimp ponds in Bunaken National Park, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 160-170. The world has lost a large extent of mangroves, while rates of recovery of these ecosystems from natural re-growth and restoration are slow. We developed a hydrological restoration technique to investigate the importance of hydrological modification in mangrove restoration success. Ecological Mangrove Restoration was adopted to restore abandoned shrimp ponds at Tiwoho, Bunaken National Park, North Sulawesi. Hydrological modification resulted in the creation of various mangrove sub-habitat conditions. These conditions remained unstable within the first three years and became relatively stable after seven years. Tidal inundation and soil surface salinity appeared to be the major factors controlling mangrove establishment and growth. All natural recruits and planted trees grew faster and produced more propagules/fruits within a short period of time after the normal physical conditions achieved. The restored site was covered by approximately 91.3 % of vegetation with the same canopy species composition as the natural stands. The practiced hydrological restoration method was simple, cost-effective and can help other practitioners in improving their mangrove restoration techniques. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - The European oyster Ostrea edulis is a keystone species that is internationally recognised as ‘threatened and declining’ in the NE Atlantic by OSPAR and several nations have consequently adopted strategies for its conservation and restoration. Understanding the settlement behaviour of O. edulis larvae is crucial to inform these strategies. We compared the efficiency of several treatments in triggering settlement. The most effective settlement occurred with the presence of conspecifics: 100% settled in <23 h. Marine stones with habitat-associated biofilms induced 81% settlement that started after a 45 h delay. Sterile shells and terrestrial stones did not induce more settlement than control treatments. These results indicate that O. edulis larvae are gregarious and finely-tuned to settle in response to cues which are indicative of their adult habitat requirements. The role of chemical cues in mediating settlement, and the importance of this to restoration, are discussed. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Early seral vegetation was studied on a former lake bottom after the removal of the 64-m-tall Glines Canyon Dam on the Elwha River. In 2015, vegetation cover of all vascular plant species was determined in 63 plots located on sites that emerged in 2011–2012. The sites had been planted and/or seeded, or were permitted to revegetate spontaneously. The plots were further classified by substrate texture: coarse sediments on the valley bottom and fine ones on the valley slopes. Plots were located randomly along random transects perpendicular to the former lake shore that extended into coarse sediment terraces perched above the floodplain. Additionally, 32 plots were sampled in surrounding native forests near these transects. Data were analyzed by detrended correspondence analysis and by canonical correspondence analysis. Substrate texture, that is whether fine or coarse, appeared to explain most of the variability in vegetation. The distance to forest and successional age, that is time since the site had been drained, were also significant explanatory variables, while assisted restoration by planting and seeding appeared to be insignificant to date. Spontaneous succession on fine sediments led to a species composition approaching that of adjacent natural forests. Invasive species were much less abundant than expected. Spontaneous restoration of vegetation on fine sediments in drained lake bottoms can rapidly produce a desirable vegetation composition and structure. On coarse sediments, active restoration may be useful to accelerate the development of native vegetation communities. © 2018 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Neonatal brachial plexus palsy is a devastating complication after a difficult delivery. The incidence of this injury has not significantly decreased over the past decades, despite all the advances in perinatal care. Although primary repair of the nerves with microsurgical techniques is the common treatment strategy nowadays, there are late cases in which secondary procedures in tendons or bones are necessary. Moreover, secondary procedures may be needed to improve the results of primary repair. A careful preoperative assessment of all the residual defects and deformities in upper limbs of these patients is essential. The aim of these procedures is usually to restore the deficient shoulder abduction and external rotation, release of any elbow flexion contracture or to correct a weak elbow flexion. More distally a supination or pronation deformity is usually apparent, and available options include tendon transfers or radial osteotomy. The wrist of these patients may be ulnarly deviated or may has absent extension, so tendon transfers or free muscle transfers can also be used for correction of these deformities. In severe cases, wrist fusion is an alternative option. The clinical presentation of the hand is highly variable due to complex deformities including thumb adduction deformity, metacarpophalangeal joints drop, and weak finger flexion or extension depending on the level of the injury. Each of these deformities can be restored with a combination of soft tissue procedures like local or free muscle transfer and bony procedures like arthrodesis. © 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As the “brain” of the entire adaptive optical (AO) system, the processing ability of the wave-front processor determines the closed-loop control bandwidth and the correction effect of the adaptive optics. Wave-front restoration is the core of wave-front processing, and its operation delay is an important index for measuring the entire wave-front processing capability. In this paper, a high parallelism and extensible wave-front restoration algorithm is designed to upgrade and optimize the original algorithm in combination with the characteristics of the field-programmable gate arrays’ high parallelism. Open-loop leveling and closed-loop correction experiments are conducted on 961- and 137-units deformable mirror AO systems. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the wave-front processing of large-scale AO systems. © 2018

AB  - The Adyar estuary is one of the highly productive transitional zones of southeast India, situated in the southern part of Chennai city and acts as a nursery ground for several endemic flora and fauna. Since few decades, due to anthropogenic activities,indiscriminate dumping and discharge of domestic and industrial wastes and pollutants has environmentally damaged the Adyar estuary lowering many of its ecological and socio-economic attributes. In order to mitigate further environmental damage and to restore it to its earlier pristine condition, the Government and several non-Governmental agencies have undertaken ecological restoration measures to enhance its ecology and diversity. In order to evaluate the restoration process, our present study attempts to assess the diversity and abundance of zooplankton population in the restored and non-restored parts of the Adyar creek and estuary. 34 species belonging to 12 zooplankton groups from 4 stations of the Adyar creek and estuary were recorded. Copepods and rotifers were the dominant groups of zooplankton in Adyar estuary. The overall density of zooplankton from 4 stations ranged between 11.5 ± 4.39 and 23,046.67 ± 2872.68 Ind l−1. In general, Adyar estuary recorded higher zooplankton abundance than creek. The relative percentage composition was maximum for rotifers with 85.67% at Station-IV. Copepods dominated Station-I, whereas rotifers dominated the other 3 stations. Overall results indicate that the restoration activities had beneficial effect on the hydrological parameters and in increasing the diversity of zooplankton in the restored part of the Adyar creek and estuary compared to the non-restored part. Ecological indices have been used to assess the present status of the restored and non-restored parts in the Adyar creek and estuary. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In order to solve the problem of blurred image when the visual guidance vehicle used to locate a two-dimensional code to acquire images, a blurred image restoration algorithm based on the optimal number of iterations for visual guidance vehicles was proposed. Firstly, the process of image blurring was modeled according to the above method. The Lucy-Richardson algorithm based on the optimal number of iterations was designed and the experimental results were verified by the independently developed visual guidance vehicle. The experimental results show that the algorithm based on best iteration number of visual guidance vehicle blurred image restoration algorithm is superior to the traditional Wiener filter algorithm in suppressing noise, improving the quality of the restored image and enhancing the fastness, the best number of restores is 20 times, it improves the speed of correcting and control precision of the visual guide vehicle, the vision tracking vehicle tracking accuracy is stabilized at 3.5 mm or less. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze the clinical success of direct light-activated composite resin restorations in posterior teeth. The quality of the margins and occlusal surfaces were evaluated, as well as their survival, according to their extensions and locations. The clinical performance of posterior composite resin restorations with different compositions were compared. All restorations were performed by the first author in his private practice, in a 5- to 20-year period. Materials and Methods: Several types of composite resins, provided by different manufacturers, were placed in posterior teeth, after isolation with rubber dams. To be included in the study, the restorations had to have been in function for at least 5 years and had to have been placed between October 1993 and October 2008 by the first author. The established failure criteria were: tooth and/or restoration fracture, secondary caries, endodontic treatment, or tooth loss. Included patients must have been treated in the first author's office for at least 7 years and still in the practice through 2013; all patients had complete dental arches. Patients with removable dental prostheses or disabilities, who had moved, or who had died were excluded. Of 210 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 138 randomly selected subjects were clinically examined between November 2013 and April 2014. Of these 138 patients, 61 had received 105 direct-light-activated composite resin restorations in posterior teeth, which met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine patients (47.5%) underwent annual maintenance therapy. The patient-based data collected from clinical exams and personal records were recorded on a specially designed form. Age, gender, period of clinical attendance, tooth preparation, location, size, quality and longevity of the restorations, restorative materials, adhesive systems, parafunctional habits, secondary caries, and maintenance therapy were the variables evaluated. Authors were blinded to the clinical assessments. Cohen's Kappa coefficient of the quality analysis of the margins and occlusal surfaces of the restorations ranged from 0.78 to 1. Data processing was performed using Epidat software, v3.1, developed by the Consellería de Sanidade de la Xunta de Galicia with the support of PAHO-WHO and SPSS software v13.0. If the number of complete values was too small, a Kaplan-Meier curve could not be used. Therefore the Fisher's exact test, Chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney non-parametric test were indicated to analyze significant differences. Results: At the time of the examinations, 103 (98%) restorations were in function, and 98 (95.1%) were rated as clinically successful. Two restorations failed (2%). The observed mean survival time of restorations that remained functional was 11 years and 7 months. Conclusions: In the present report, direct light-activated composite resin restorations in posterior teeth showed a high clinical success rate and long-term mean survival time. These composite resins might be considered the material of choice to restore medium, extended, and in some clinical situations, large preparations in posterior teeth. © 2017 by the American College of Prosthodontists

AB  - Wind energy is rapidly growing. While wind brings us clean and inexpensive energy, its inherent variability and uncertainty present challenges for the power grid. In particular, employing wind energy for power system restoration is very challenging. A fast and reliable restoration plays a vital role to achieve the self-healing power grid. This paper develops a novel offline restoration planning tool for harnessing wind energy to enhance grid resilience. The wind-for-restoration problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming problem with generated wind energy scenarios. The problem is then decomposed into two stages and solved with the integer L-shaped algorithm. Numerical experiments have been conducted through different case studies using the modified IEEE 57-bus system. The developed tool can provide the scheduled wind power at each restoration time. The impact of wind energy is investigated from the aspects of location and inertia capability, as well as wind penetration, fluctuation, and uncertainty. Moreover, a dynamic response validation tool is developed to validate the results of optimization problem in a dynamic simulation software. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal wind harnessing strategy can help improve system restoration process and enhance system resilience. © 2010-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The hyporheic zone (HZ) is an area of interaction between surface and ground waters present in and around river beds. Bidirectional mixing within the HZ, termed hyporheic exchange flow (HEF), plays significant roles in nutrient transport, organic matter and biogeochemical processing in rivers. The functional importance of the HZ in river ecology and hydrology suggests that river managers should consider the HZ in their planning to help compromised systems recover. However, current river restoration planning tools do not take into account the HZ. This paper describes a novel multiscale, transferable method that combines existing environmental information at different spatial scales to identify areas with potentially significant HEF for use in restoration prioritization and planning. It uses a deductive approach that is suited for data-poor case studies, which is common for most rivers, given the very limited data on the spatial occurrence of areas of hyporheic exchange. Results on nine contrasting European rivers, demonstrate its potential to inform river management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wear debris analysis is used for machine condition monitoring because it is capable of identifying wear related faults in machinery components. In particular, wear mechanisms can be explored based on debris shape and texture features. As current wear monitoring practices prefer rapid data interpretation, on-line ferrograph is favored where debris images are collected and processed on-site with an imaging apparatus. However, such images are often blurred due to lubricant contamination and limited optical field depth. This drawback makes the subsequent investigation of wear debris features a challenging task. To address this issue, a restoration method is developed to reduce the influence of out-of-focus blurring in on-line ferrograph images. Firstly, in order to model the out-of-focus blurring process, a degradation model is constructed with a convolutional neural network. Different from general deep learning structures, larger convolutional kernels are embedded in the network to more comprehensively characterize the blurring process. Next, training samples of different types of debris are collected in the laboratory. The neural network structure then is optimized to minimize the difference between restored images and their corresponding ground truths. The final restoration is conducted based on the trained network via a pixel-wise regression process. To evaluate the performance of the developed method, experiments are carried out with debris images collected from a gear-box test rig. Results have demonstrated that: (1) the proposed restoration strategy allows robust extractions of debris features in greater detail; (2) the developed method is more computationally efficient than traditional deblurring techniques, which enables it to be applicable in on-line machine health monitoring. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The distinct traditional building substance in Albania and Kosovo is made up of impressive residential houses (banesa) for rich landlords, warlords, tax collectors and merchants performing a rural-urban lifestyle. Therefore, a sophisticated blend of the all-time defendable Albanian tower house (kulla), still existing quite intact in the western Kosovo plains, and the comfortable Turkish residence was developed during the long centuries of the Ottoman rule over Western Balkans. With the distinct knowledge of the widely renowned Albanian interdisciplinary craftsmanship of stone cutters, masons and carpenters, earthquake resistant and comfortable structures were successfully erected on most difficult morphological sites, which nowadays for manifold reasons are heavily endangered. This article tries to describe the reasons for those man-caused dangers and, in three case-studies from Dranoc, Gjakova and Gjirokastra, already taken counter-measures. Interestingly all those efforts are not only interdisciplinary approached, but try also to create sustainable regional employment by means of maintenance and restoration work. Especially the Gjirokastra model with its revival of the former state-protected “conservation ateliers” looks promising. Nowadays the knowledge of those “conservation-atelier” craftsmen is not formally recognized and left out of the market. Therefore, and to revive the apprentice school idea, Cultural Heritage without Borders has started a vocational training program to guarantee employability for tomorrow. © 2019, RILEM.

AB  - The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important organisms with enormous potential for use in ecological restoration due to their positive association to seedlings. We evaluated the effects of soil degradation on a species-rich AMF community that could hinder the restoration of rupestrian grassland sites whose soil had been removed. Soil samples were taken from reference and degraded sites. We assessed the density, species richness, and composition of AMF, as well as soil macronutrients, metals, and texture. We found lower AMF density and richness in degraded than in reference sites. AMF community seemed to be negatively affected by a low level of potassium (K) and a higher concentration of heavy metals and clay in degraded sites. Besides the shifts in AMF composition associated mainly with K concentration, we found that the lack of this nutrient in degraded sites was also related to a significant reduction in density of AMF species, which are thought to play important roles in plant development and, therefore, in ecological restoration. Thus, we emphasize that efforts to restore degraded areas of rupestrian grassland should contemplate the reestablishment of soil physical and chemical properties, such as a lower clay concentration, and levels of nutrients that are key for AMF colonization. In addition, we suggest the further development of protocols for inoculation of seedlings and soil with AMF species to improve the success of replantation. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Marram grass (Ammophila arenaria L. Link (marram grass; Poaceae) has been identified as a major threat to the biodiversity of temperate dune systems outside its natural range. Coastal management and conservation agencies in a number of countries have invested in dune restoration programs involving the removal of invasive species, including marram grass. We investigate the age, viability and the depth distribution of buried seeds of this dune grass within two foredunes in southern New Zealand. The germinability of seeds of known age was determined at St Kilda Beach, Dunedin, New Zealand, to derive a minimum age for the seedbank. Seed was extracted by coring through a foredune to layers of sand of known age based on a time series of foredune-beach profiles. The potential of marram grass to develop large seedbanks in ideal conditions of vigorous plant growth and rapid foredune accretion, was investigated at Mason Bay. Buried seed was extracted using hand-corers to a maximum depth of 4.01 m and tested for germinability. A high proportion of excavated A. arenaria seeds were viable at both sites, including seeds recovered from 4 m depth at St Kilda, estimated to be at least 21 years old. We found no trend of declining viability with increasing depth at Mason Bay, suggesting seed may remain viable for longer than 21 years. Persistent, long-lived, seed banks of A. arenaria develop in foredunes. Restoration programs aiming to eradicate this species are likely to be prolonged (years to decades) as a result of regeneration from seeds that re-enter the shallow seed bank as dunes erode. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Statement of problem: The association between tooth type, location in the dental arch, and selection of a post-and-core system for endodontically treated teeth is unclear. Information on the influence of these parameters on the failure rate of teeth treated with post-and-core restorations is needed. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the available evidence on the failure rates of anterior and posterior teeth treated with post-and-core restorations. Material and methods: A search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database, Brazilian Library in Dentistry, Cochrane Library, and Gray literature for randomized clinical trials comparing the failure rates of anterior and posterior teeth treated with post-and-core restorations. The risk of bias tool from the Cochrane Collaboration was used for quality assessment of the studies. Results: The search strategy identified 2526 articles, and 6 studies were included in the meta-analysis. No difference in the failure rate of post-and-core restorations placed in anterior and posterior teeth was found in most studies. The risk ratio for anterior versus posterior teeth was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.64; P=.79). The risk ratio for incisors versus canines was 3.08 (95% CI, 0.56-17.04; P=.20) and that for premolars versus molars was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.12-1.74; P=.25). The risk ratio for prefabricated glass fiber posts on anterior versus posterior teeth was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.61-2.09; P=.70) and that for metal posts was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.64-1.91; P=.72). Conclusions: The failure rates in anterior and posterior teeth treated with post-and-core restorations were similar at short- to medium-term follow-up. More well-designed clinical trials comparing the survival and failure rates of anterior and posterior teeth treated with post-and-core restorations with longer follow-up times are needed. © 2018 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry

Here we show that activation of Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) with CDN1163, a novel small molecule allosteric SERCA activator, ameliorates the muscle impairment in the CuZnSOD deficient (Sod1-/-) mouse model of oxidative stress. Sod1-/- mice are characterized by reduced SERCA activity, muscle weakness and atrophy, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Seven weeks of CDN1163 treatment completely restored SERCA activity and reversed the 23% reduction in gastrocnemius mass and 22% reduction in specific force in untreated Sod1-/- versus wild type mice. These changes were accompanied by restoration of autophagy protein markers to the levels found in wild-type mice. CDN1163 also reversed the increase in mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative damage in muscle tissue from Sod1-/- mice. Taken together our findings suggest that the pharmacological restoration of SERCA is a promising therapeutic approach to counter oxidative stress-associated muscle impairment. © 2018

AB  - Purpose: To compare the fracture resistance of monolithic reinforced glass-ceramic restorations with bilayer zirconia-based restorations. Materials and Methods: Fifteen ceramic crowns were fabricated on epoxy dies duplicated from a stainless steel master die. They were divided into 3 equal groups (n = 5) according to the type of ceramic material used: group I, monolithic lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD), group V, monolithic zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (Vita Suprinity), and group B (bilayered zirconia substructure with veneering ceramic). All specimens were cemented on epoxy dies with a self-adhesive resin cement (Rely X Unicem), subjected to a chewing simulator, and then loaded until fracture in a universal testing machine. The results were tabulated and statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA to compare among the 3 materials. The Bonferroni post hoc test was used for pairwise comparisons when the ANOVA test was significant. Results: Zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (Vita Suprinity) crowns showed the highest statistically significant (p < 0.05) mean fracture resistance values (1742.9 ± 102.7 N), followed by lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD) (1565.2 ± 89.7 N). Bilayered zirconia-based crowns showed the lowest statistically significantly mean fracture resistance values (1267.8 ± 86.1 N). Conclusions: Monolithic reinforced glass-ceramics (lithium disilicate and zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate) have better fracture resistance than bilayered zirconia-based ceramics. Clinical implications: The use of monolithic reinforced ceramic restorations (lithium disilicate and zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate) is preferred to bilayered zirconia-based restorations to avoid chipping of the ceramic veneer. © 2017 by the American College of Prosthodontists

AB  - We present a novel approach for image denoising with spatial domain edge preservation method to yield denoised image, from an image which is distorted by additive white Gaussian noise without loss of detail information of an image. Denoising of noise corrupted images while preserving its attributes like edges and fine details is an extreme challenge. During image acquisition and transmission often noise gets added in the image which degrades the image quality. Algorithms like NL means and BM3D have been very successful in this aspect. The weight assigned to the fellow pixels for calculating replacement for a noisy pixels have a pivotal role in these algorithms. In NL means, the weight assigned to a pixel depends only on its relative magnitude with respect to its neighborhood. In this paper we are proposing a robust mechanism for weight calculation which also considers the orientation of a pixel. Using this mechanism we got improvement in PSNR and visual quality of the de-noised image as compared to the NL means method and also got improvement in structural similarity as compared to the BM3D. From the experimental results it can be seen that our proposed algorithm is superior in comparison to the NL means and BM3D technique of image denoising, considering the factors like PSNR, SSIM and accordingly conclusions are drawn. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.
