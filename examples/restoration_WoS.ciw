AB Magnetic microparticles (MPs) have been recently proposed as innovative and promising dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) adsorbents. However, before using them in a whole-lake restoration project, it is essential to assess their toxicological effects (direct and indirect) on aquatic biota. In the present study we hypothesized that zooplankton community is affected by MPs used for lake restoration. To test our hypothesis we designed a microcosms experiment (n = 15) containing lake water and surface sediment from a hypertrophic lake. Temporal changes (70 days) on physico-chemical conditions and on zooplankton structure (rotifers, copepods and branchiopods) were monitored under different scenarios. In particular, three different treatments were considered: no addition of MPs (control) and MPs addition (1.4 g MPs L-1) on the surface water layer (T-W) and on the sediment (T-S). After 24 h of contact time, MPs were removed with a magnetic rake. A total of 15 zooplankton species (12 rotifers, 1 branchiopod and 2 copepods) were recorded and a high abundance of zooplankton was registered during the experiment for all treatments. No significant differences (RM-ANOVA test; p > 0.05) in total abundance, species richness and species diversity among treatments were found. The absence of any effect of MPs on zooplankton can be explained because MPs did not significantly alter any of its physico-chemical (e.g. temperature, pH, O-2) or biological (e.g. food quantity and quality) drivers. These results confirm the suitability of MPs as a promising tool for removing DIP in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Riparian habitats are transitional zones where strong environmental gradients shape community. To prevent flood risks and channel migration on managed rivers, civil engineering techniques have been widely used. Recently, ecological restoration of rivers has become a major issue. However, given the alteration of natural disturbance regimes induced by human infrastructures, the real added-value of these restoration actions is questionable. Thus, a major challenge is to better understand whether changes in abiotic conditions induced by human activity influence the response of plant communities to environmental gradients. Studying a highly degraded large river, we evaluated the effect of the elevation and soil texture gradients on plant functional composition and assessed whether human-mediated environment gradients, achieved through maintenance and restoration measures, shape community structure. In the summer of 2017, we sampled 17 geomorphic surfaces, mostly gravel bars, along the Rhone River and its tributaries that were either repeatedly cleared (brush clearing vs plowing), newly reprofiled or naturally rejuvenated by high flows. The results show shifts in trait values with elevation and convergence in plant traitswith increasing proportion of fine sediments. The co-occurrence of species with contrasting traits was higher in highly disturbed environments, revealing the importance of rejuvenation processes. However, the influence of both environmental gradients was mediated by human activity. For maintenancemeasures, plowingwas better able to promote species diversity and limited biotic homogenization along environmental gradients. Among the three geomorphic surfaces, naturally rejuvenated barswere themost stressful environments, hosting distinct functional assemblages, while communities on newly reprofiled banks were in the same ecological trajectories as repeatedly cleared bars. To promote an effective ecological restoration of riparian zones, (i) a greater variability of the minimum flow is needed, (ii) bedload transport restoration should be a priority and (iii) reprofiled banks should better mimic the landforms of natural river margins.

AB Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) is a network designed and planned to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and to protect biodiversity. Existing GBI designs lacked a systematic method to allocate restoration zones. This study proposes a novel approach for systematically selecting cost-effective areas for restoration on the basis of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and ecosystem condition to give an optimal spatial design of GBI. The approach was tested at a regional scale, in a transboundary setting encompassing the Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean in Andalusia (Spain) - Morocco (IBRM), across three aquatic ecosystems: freshwater, coastal and marine. We applied Marxan with Zones to stakeholder-defined scenarios of GBI in the IBRM. Specifically, we aimed to identify management zones within the GBl that addressed different conservation, restoration and exploitation objectives. Although almost all conservation targets were achieved, our results highlighted that the proportion of conservation features (i.e., biodiversity, ecosystem services) that would be compromised in the GBl, and the proportion of provisioning services that would be lost due to conservation (i.e., incidental representation) are potentially large, indicating that the probability of conflicts between conservation and exploitation goals in the area is high. The implementation of restoration zones improved connectivity across the GBI, and also achieved European and global policy targets. Our approach may help guide future applications of GBI to implement the flexible conservation management that aquatic environments require, considering many areas at different spatial scales, across multiple ecosystems, and in transboundary contexts.

AB Objective. In the present study, we investigated the fusion process between amorphous microparticles of the calcium salt of the physiological polymer comprising orthophosphate units, of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), and enamel.
   Methods. This polymer was incorporated as an ingredient into toothpaste and the fusion process was studied by electron microscopy and by synchrotron-based X-ray tomography microscopy (SRXTM) techniques.
   Results. The data showed that toothpaste, supplemented with the amorphous Ca-polyP microparticles (aCa-polyP-MP), not only reseals tooth defects on enamel, like carious lesions, and dentin, including exposed dentinal tubules, but also has the potential to induce remineralization in the enamel and dentin regions. The formation of a regeneration mineralic zone on the tooth surface induced by aCa-polyP-MP was enhanced upon exposure to artificial saliva, as demonstrated by SRXTM. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis revealed an increase in the calcium/phosphorus atomic ratio of the enamel deposits to values characteristic for the particles during the treatment with polyP applied in the toothpaste, indicating a fusion of the particles with the tooth mineral.
   Significance. Our results suggest that toothpaste enriched with aCa-polyP-MP is a promising biomimetic material for accelerating enamel and dentin restoration. (C) 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. The objective of this randomized controlled prospective clinical trial was to evaluate the short time clinical behaviour of an altered resin modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC), which is claimed to possess bioactivity, in posterior restorations and to compare it intraindividually with a nanofilled resin composite.
   Methods. Totally 78 pairs Class II and 4 pairs Class I restorations were placed in 29 female and 38 male participants with a mean age of 58.3 years (range 37-86). Each patient received at random at least one pair of, as similar as possible, Class II or Class I restorations. In the first cavity of each pair, the modified flowable RMGIC (ACTIVA Bioactive; AB) was placed after phosphoric acid etching of the cavity and without adhesive, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In the other cavity a well established nanofilled resin composite (CeramX; RC) with a single step self-etch adhesive (Xeno Select) was placed. The restorations were evaluated using slightly modified USPHS criteria at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Caries risk and parafunctional habits of the participants were estimated.
   Results. 158 restorations, 8 Class I and 150 Class II, were evaluated at the one year recalls. At baseline two failed restorations were observed (2AB), at 6 months six failures (5AB, 1RC) and at 12 months another thirteen failed restorations were observed (12AB, 1RC). This resulted in annual failure rates of 24.1% for the AB and 2.5% for RC (p < 0.0001). The main reasons for failure for AB were lost restorations (5), postoperative symptoms (4) and secondary caries (3). Do to the unacceptable very high one-year failure frequency, the clinical study was stopped and no further evaluation will be performed.
   Significance. The use of the AB restorative in Class II cavities, applied as instructed by the manufacturer after a short phosphoric acid pretreatment but without adhesive system, resulted in a non-acceptable very high failure frequency after a one year period. Further studies should be conducted using a bonding agent (C) 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB China has made considerable efforts to mitigate the pollution of lakes over the past decade, but the success rate of these restoration actions at a national scale remains unclear. The present study compiled a 13-year (2005-2017) comprehensive dataset consisting of 24,319 records from China's 142 lakes and reservoirs. We developed a novel Water Quality Index (WQI-DET), customized to China's water quality classification scheme, to investigate the spatio-temporal pollution patterns. The likelihood of regime shifts during our study period is examined with a sequential algorithm. Our analysis suggests that China's lake water quality has improved and is also characterized by two WQI-DET abrupt shifts in 2007 and 2010. However, we also found that the eutrophication problems have not been eradicated and heavy metal (HM) pollution displayed an increasing trend. Our study suggests that the control of Cr, Cd and As should receive particular attention in an effort to alleviate the severity of HM pollution. Priority strategies to control HM pollution include the reduction of the contribution from mining activities and implementation of soil remediation in highly polluted areas. The mitigation efforts of lake eutrophication are more complicated due to the increasing importance of internal nutrient loading that can profoundly modulate the magnitude and timing of system response to external nutrient loading reduction strategies. We also contend that the development of a rigorous framework to quantify the socioeconomic benefits from well-functioning lake and reservoir ecosystems is critically important to gain leeway and keep the investments to the environment going, especially if the water quality improvements in many Chinese lakes and reservoirs are not realized in a timely manner.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the biomechanical comparison of channel-assisted minimally invasive restoration and three common Achilles tendon restoration techniques in an in vitro model via a progressive rehabilitation program. The 42 porcine tendons were randomly assigned to the following six groups of tendons (n=7/group): Achillon, percutaneous Achilles repair system (PARS), Krackow, channel-assisted minimally invasive repair (CAMIR), CAMIR augmentation (CAMIR(+)), CAMIR-5 (repair with No. 5 Ethibond suture). There was no significant difference in elongation among groups following the first 10 loading cycles, which consisted of 20-100 N at 1 Hz. The elongation of the CAMIR group (7.51 +/- 1.77 mm) was significantly longer than the Achillon group (3.19 +/- 0.57 mm) and PARS group (3.73 +/- 0.66 mm; P<0.05) following 1,000 cycles. However, the CAMIR group exhibited no significant difference vs. the Krackow (7.32 +/- 1.09 mm) and CAMIR(+) groups (7.11 +/- 1.50 mm) following 1,000 cycles. Following 2,000 cycles, there was no significant difference between the CAMIR-5 (7.99 +/- 1.68 mm) group, and the Achillon (3.19 +/- 0.57 mm) and PARS groups (3.73 +/- 0.66 mm). At the point of restoration construct failure, the total cycles of the CAMIR group (median, 1,000; range, 1,000-1,000) were significantly less than the Achillon group (median, 2,000; range, 2,000-2,013) and PARS group (median, 2,000; range, 2,000-2,010; P<0.05), but had no significant difference compared with the Krackow group (median, 1,000; range, 1,000-1,000) and CAMIR(+) group 1,000 (median, 1,000; range, 1,000-1,004). There was also no significant difference between the CAMIR-5 group (median, 2,000; range, 2,000-2,000), and the Achillon group (median, 2,000; range, 2,000-2,013) and PARS group (median, 2,000; range, 2,000-2,010). Restricted by the strength of suture, the one-suture CAMIR restoration technique was weaker than the three-suture Achillon and PARS restoration techniques, but there was no significant difference with the open Krackow restoration technique, which provides a reliable mechanical strength for repairing. CAMIR has an advantage of reducing the risk of suture reactivity.

AB Environmental flow, one of the main restoration measures for regulated rivers, aims to restore and sustain degraded riparian ecosystems and the human wellbeing that depends on these ecosystems with a reasonable magnitude, frequency, duration and timing of water flow. However, efficacies of environmental flows are often restrained by other demands along the river and inappropriate water management, leading to only spatially limited habitats being suitable for ecosystem functioning. This paper presents current restoration measures in the lower reaches of the Tarim riparian ecosystem in Northwest China and analyzes ecohydrological dynamics as a function of environmental flows. The groundwater level oscillation before/after and during the environmental flows (i.e., manmade water diversion) was examined, and the Mann-Kendall test was applied to identify the overall trend of change in groundwater depth from 2003 to 2011. The growth, distribution, health status (referred to as "vitality") and renewal potentials of the dominant tree species Populus euphratica were quantified by using individual-based repeated measurements of P. euphratica morphology in two sampling sites (a 100-ha permanent plot and five random sampling plots with 50-m radii) at Arghan village in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. Based on these measurements, the effects of restoration measures on the groundwater recharge and the revitalization of degraded trees were assessed. The main contribution and achievements of the water diversion project on rehabilitation of the degraded riparian forests were evaluated; further, the limitations and challenges faced by of the restoration project were examined. The results of this research could help establish a reference for monitoring changes in riparian forests in Central Asia and possibly recommend restoration measures for riparian forest ecosystems in arid regions worldwide.

AB The rise of restoration projects on large rivers is a response to the increasing human-induced pressures on these ecosystems. Despite this, there is a relative lack of data documenting restoration success using macroinvertebrate communities in such environments, with those existing frequently producing contrasting results. Here, we examined post-restoration responses of macroinvertebrates following a unique experimental restoration approach based on controlled bank erosion and artificial groyne implementation, initiated in 2013 on the Old Rhine River (France-Germany). We investigated how macroinvertebrate communities have responded to restoration-induced variations in three main abiotic parameters, i.e. water depth, flow velocity and substrate type, by comparing the restored section with unrestored ones. The Eco-hydro-morphological index (EHMID), a modified version of a hydro-morphological diversity index, showed a gain in mesohabitat heterogeneity along the whole site. Newly created mesohabitats with low flow velocity and finer substrate were dissimilar to those along the rest of the Old Rhine channel, favouring burrowing taxa such as Odonata. The presence of such insect larvae was related to the post-restoration emergence of typical alluvial terrestrial-aquatic border connectivity, and the rise in macrophytes over time. On the whole site, changes in composition or in functional profile diversity were highly related to the high degree of mesohabitat heterogeneity from the restored section, which would persist as long as groynes remain. The main inter-annual effect concerned the decrease in invasive taxa abundance that also varied according to any changes in fluvial forms. Our findings confirmed that macroinvertebrate responses are highly influenced by hydrological events and are dependent on the study-scale monitoring, clearly putting forward fine-scale hydromorphological gradients. Biological results from this restoration project should approach those obtained in smaller rivers restored using deflectors, suggesting a potential application of the hydraulic law of similarities. However, the accuracy of biological prediction using said application is limited by the distance from source populations, biological invasions and internal river dynamics.

AB Monitoring and evaluating forest restoration projects is a challenge especially in large-scale, but the remote monitoring of indicators with the use of synoptic, multispectral and multitemporal data allows us to gauge the restoration success with more accurately and in small time. The objective of this study was to elaborate and compare methods of remote monitoring of forest restoration using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and multispectral imaging from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) camera, in addition to comparing the efficiency of supervised classification algorithms Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Random Forest (RF). The study was carried out in a restoration area with about 74 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A., in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, Near Infrared) on UAV and LIDAR data composition (intensity image, Digital Surface Model, Digital Terrain Model, normalized Digital Surface Model). The monitored restoration indicator was the land cover separated in three classes: canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the ML and RF algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifications, the Overall Accuracy (OA) and the Kappa index were used, and the last was compared by Z test. The area occupied by different land cover classes was calculated using ArcGIS and R. The results of OA, Kappa and visual evaluation of the images were excellent in all combinations of the imaging methods and algorithms analyzed. When Kappa values for the two algorithms were compared, RF presented better performance than ML with significant difference, but when sensors (UAV camera and LIDAR) were compared, there were no significant differences. There was little difference between the area occupied by each land cover classes generated by UAV and LIDAR images. The highest cover was generated for canopy cover followed by grass cover and bare soil in all classified images, indicating the need of adaptive management interventions to correct the area trajectory towards the restoration success. The methods employed in this study are efficient to monitor restoration areas, especially on a large scale, allowing us to save time, fieldwork and invested resources.

AB Open-pit mining activities can cause serious disturbance to the local land and even regional vegetation communities. Vegetation restoration is a crucial approach for maintaining ecological stability in a post-mining area. In this study, the role of the environment factors on vegetation diversity under different restoration years (2a, 5a, 10a and control area) in the largest phosphate mining areas in Southwestern China was evaluated by a multi-model inference (MMI) based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Three competing models of environmental factors included vegetation nutrient content (M1), soil heavy metal content (M2) and human disturbance (M3) were constructed to analyze how they impact vegetation diversity. The results revealed the changing effects of different environmental factors under four restoration stages. Heavy metal content in the soil (M2) had the strongest effect on vegetation diversity in the restoration areas at 2 and 10 years, whereas human disturbance (M3) had the strongest effect in the restoration area at 5 years. In the control area, the vegetation nutrient content (M1) had the strongest effect on vegetation diversity. According to the different models, a comprehensive index of environmental factors (CIEF) was established to build the fitting formula with vegetation diversity. The index could be used for assessing the efficiency of vegetation restoration by comparing the theoretical value and the actual value of Shannon's diversity index in the study area and other phosphate mining areas.

AB Chemical and biological functioning of artificial wetlands and lakes in alluvial plains is investigated based on the example of small artificial ponds located within dike fields along the Rhone River (France). The objective is to identify the diversity of metabolism in these artificial aquatic ecosystems and to propose a functional classification linked to the connectivity with the river. A comprehensive characterization of chemical and biological parameters in six shallow ponds was conducted, along with 4-month continuous monitoring of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration, both in the sub-surface and at depth. Metabolism intensity is quantified using the diel oxygen method. Multivariate analysis of chemical and biological characteristics is performed to identify the functional heterogeneity between the ponds, which is shown to be consistent with the intensity of primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). Some ponds are permanently connected to the river, like backwater, and are very turbid, because of suspended matter and the presence of phytoplankton. The oxygenation is limited to the surface layer with anoxia rapidly building up at the bottom due to an intense ER. Ponds that are rarely connected become eutrophic with large concentration of phytoplankton and large GPP and ER values. Anoxia and even denitrification occur close to the bottom sediment. Finally, in the ponds with intermediate degree of connection with the river, macrophytes grow in clear water with limited amount of phytoplankton, resulting in a gradient of GPP and ER values, controlled by nutrient availability. Rehabilitation of various connection patterns with the river is thus crucial to maintain a functional diversity in large river alluvial plains.

AB Mowing is a common management technique employed in Europe and North America to manage seral wetland plant communities to: (a) prevent development to late succession, (b) minimise internal eutrophication and (c) conserve biodiversity. However, little is known about the effect mowing has on water quality, and the duration of any effects. Therefore, mowing treatments were applied in two abandoned fen plant communities: a Schoenus nigricans-Juncus subnodulosus (SN) community (hand-cutting) and a Cladio-Molinietum (CM) community (machine mowing). Mowing took place once in each community across three sites in North Wales, U.K. Effects on water chemistry were followed for two years post mowing.

AB In central eastern Korea, there has been a continued effort to sustain pine forests because of their value for wood and mushroom production, as well as for other resources. Through the analysis of previously burned areas, we clarified the effects of fire on vegetation dynamics of pine forests by measuring changes in species composition, population structure, and the growth rates of major tree species. Vegetation analysis was conducted on a series of 100m(2) plots established in Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora Siebold. & Zucc.) and Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch. Ex Ledeb.) forests situated in three different topographic positions on slopes where fire severity varied. We confirmed that most pine trees will succumb to even a surface fire, whereas oak may be killed following high intensity or infrequent fires but will sprout and become dominant. Complete protection from fire favors other, more shade-tolerant deciduous hardwoods. Different restoration plans apply, based on observed vegetation responses for each topographic zone. Near the ridge top, where pine seed sources are most limited, it may be necessary to restore pine forests by planting and to control competing shrubs and herbs. At the mountain foot, where exotic species and species modified by hybridization have invaded aggressively, restoration that involves the introduction of natural vegetation is required. Mid-slope sites, where pine has been replaced by natural vegetation dominated by Mongolian oak, do not require any form of restorative treatment.

AB Since its first announcement in 2002 and completion in 2005, restoration of Cheonggyecheon, an urban stream in downtown Seoul, South Korea, has drawn great interest internationally and locally as a model achievement of sustainable development and has triggered extensive empirical research thereafter. This study questions whether the restoration of Cheonggyecheon is sustainable. Using a systematic literature review that combines thematic synthesis and realist review, this study establishes a framework composed of the three Es of sustainable development (environment, economy, and equity) and their 36 dimensions as suggested by literature. Based on the framework, 86 studies published between 2003 and 2017 are reviewed. Results suggest that environmental sustainability is the most studied, while economic sustainability has received the least academic interest. Its equity aspect remains controversial. Overall, it is difficult to confirm Cheonggyecheon's sustainability. Many of its sustainability dimensions require further investigation, and research findings remain mixed or unclear.

AB Although experiences with ecological restoration continue to accumulate, the effectiveness of restoration for biota remains debated. We complemented a traditional taxonomic analysis approach with information on 56 species traits to uncover the responses of 3 aquatic (fish, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes) and 2 terrestrial (carabid beetles, floodplain vegetation) biotic groups to 43 hydromorphological river restoration projects in Germany. All taxonomic groups responded positively to restoration, as shown by increased taxonomic richness (10-164%) and trait diversity (habitat, dispersal and mobility, size, form, life history, and feeding groups) (15-120%). Responses, however, were stronger for terrestrial than aquatic biota, and, contrary to our expectation, taxonomic responses were stronger than those of traits. Nevertheless, trait analysis provided mechanistic insights into the drivers of community change following restoration. Trait analysis for terrestrial biota indicated restoration success was likely enhanced by lateral connectivity and reestablishment of dynamic processes in the floodplain. The weaker response of aquatic biota suggests recovery was hindered by the persistence of stressors in the aquatic environment, such as degraded water quality, dispersal constraints, and insufficient hydromorphological change. Therefore, river restoration requires combined local- and regional-scale approaches to maximize the response of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Due to the contrasting responses of aquatic and terrestrial biota, the planning and assessment of river restoration outcomes should consider effects on both components of riverine landscapes.

AB Exposure to nature can strengthen an individual's sense of connectedness (i.e., emotional/cognitive bonds to the natural world) and enhance psychological restoration (e.g., feeling relaxed/refreshed). To date, there have been few large studies looking at the role that type and quality of natural environments may have on these outcomes. The present study used data from a large survey in England (sample analyzed = 4,515), which asked participants to recall a recent visit to nature. After controlling for covariates, respondents recalled greater connectedness to nature and restoration following visits to rural and coastal locations compared with urban green space, and to sites of higher environmental quality (operationalized by protected/designated area status, for example, nature reserves). A series of structural equation analyses provided evidence for a bidirectional association between connectedness and restoration. Consideration of the psychological benefits associated with different types and quality of environment has implications for human health, environmental management, and conservation.

AB Fish harbor a high diversity of parasites that play an important role for the ecosystem. Because these parasites have different life-cycle traits, changes in their populations or communities may provide useful information related to ecosystem health. Highly stressful conditions may reduce parasite communities or populations. However, it is not a rule since host-parasite interactions are hardly predictable. In this study, macroparasites of the fish sailfin molly (Poecilia velifera) from three sites (conserved, degraded and under restoration) located within a mangrove wetland area, in the Terminos Lagoon (southern Gulf of Mexico), were analyzed in order to determine their potential use as bioindicators. A total of 198 fish were examined for parasites. Six parasite species were found: two crustaceans (Argulus sp. and Ergasilus aff. cerastes), one trematode (Centrocestus formosanus), one monogenean (Gyrodactylus sp.) and two nematodes (Contracaecum sp. and Cuculanus sp.). There were no significant differences in the structure of parasite infracommunities as well as in prevalence and intensity of parasite populations between degraded and conserved sites. However, the site under restoration had poorer infracommunities and smaller populations ofcrustaceans and trematodes, which suggests that restoration efforts have not improved the ecological conditions. Based on these results, it is conjectured that parasites of P. velifera did not show useful information to provide a diagnosis related to ecosystem health. Beyond this ecological subject, the present study represents new host record for most parasite species found.

ID GROUNDWATER; WATER; DYNAMICS; DISCHARGE; ECOLOGY; IMAGERY
AB Rohrschollen Island is an artificial island of the large Upper Rhine river whose geometry and hydrological dynamics are the result of engineering works during the 19th and 20th centuries. Before its channelization, the Rhine river was characterized by an intense hydromorphological activity which maintained a high level of biodiversity along the fluvial corridor. This functionality considerably decreased during the two last centuries. In 2012, a restoration project was launched to reactivate typical alluvial processes, including bedload transport, lateral channel dynamics, and surface-subsurface water exchanges. An integrated hydrological model has been applied to the area of Rohrschollen Island to assess the efficiency of the restoration regarding surface and subsurface flows. This model is calibrated using measured piezometric heads. Simulated patterns of water exchanges between the surface and subsurface compartments of the island are checked against the information derived from thermal infrared (TIR) imaging. The simulated results are then used to better understand the evolutions of the infiltration-exfiltration zones over time and space and to determine the physical controls of surface-subsurface interactions on the hydrographic network of Rohrschollen Island. The use of integrated hydrological modeling has proven to be an efficient approach to assess the efficiency of restoration actions regarding surface and subsurface flows.

AB A recent global trend toward retirement of farmland presents opportunities to reclaim habitat for threatened and endangered species. We examine habitat restoration opportunities in one of the world's most converted landscapes, California's San Joaquin Desert (SJD). Despite the presence of 35 threatened and endangered species, agricultural expansion continues to drive habitat loss in the SJD, even as marginal farmland is retired. Over the next decades a combination of factors, including salinization, climate change, and historical groundwater overdraft, are projected to lead to the retirement of more than 2,000 km(2) of farmland in the SJD. To promote strategic habitat protection and restoration, we conducted a quantitative assessment of habitat loss and fragmentation, habitat suitability, climatic niche stability, climate change impacts, habitat protection, and reintroduction opportunities for an umbrella species of the SJD, the endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila). We use our suitability models, in conjunction with modern and historical land use maps, to estimate the historical and modern rate of habitat loss to development. The estimated amount of habitat lost since the species became protected under endangered species law in 1967 is greater than the total amount of habitat currently protected through public ownership and conservation easement. We document climatic niche contraction and associated range contraction away from the more mesic margins of the species' historical distribution, driven by the anthropogenic introduction of exotic grasses and forbs. The impact of exotic species on G. sila range dynamics appears to be still unfolding. Finally, we use NASA fallowed area maps to identify 610 km(2) of fallowed or retired agricultural land with high potential to again serve as habitat. We discuss conservation strategies in light of the potential for habitat restoration and multiple drivers of ongoing and historical habitat loss.

AB Quaking or trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is a foundational tree species, which is native, common, and broadly distributed in North America. The ecology of aspen has been extensively studied throughout its range, but both research and forest management practices have focused primarily on its ability to regenerate asexually via root suckering. The seed-based reproductive ecology of aspen has received comparatively little attention, and information on the underlying processes, mechanisms, and requirements of seed regeneration tends to be scattered, somewhat anecdotal, or based only on localized research efforts.
   Here we review and explore some of the variables that influence the sexual reproduction and early establishment of aspen. We focus this review on western North America, where trembling aspen plays a dominant ecological role and may be disproportionately impacted by climate change. This synthesis presents existing information and identifies critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of seed based aspen regeneration, in particular as it relates to flowering and seed production, as well as germination, first year growth, and survival of aspen seedlings. This information is discussed further in the context of aspen ecology and its application in both passive and active management approaches to aspen seedling regeneration and restoration.

AB Enhancement and conservation of biodiversity in recovering communities is one of the primary goals of forest ecology and restoration. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying community assembly during restoration, we examined changes in taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity in four types of subtropical forests, consisting of a Eucalyptus plantation (EE), an Acacia mangium plantation (AM), a mixed native species plantation (NS), and a mixed coniferous plantation (MC), over 30 years of restoration (1985-2015). Temporal variation in taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarity patterns were found to differ among the four plantation types, although their taxonomic diversity (species richness) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) increased monotonically as succession proceeded. Community dissimilarity decreased nonlinearly over the 30 years, and species composition within each plantation tended to stabilize at around 20 years. Overall, the phylogenetic structure of each plantation was random during the succession period. Taxonomic and phylogenetic rates did not vary markedly along the 30 years of restoration, but the taxonomic turnover rate of MC increased significantly while the phylogenetic turnover rate of NC augmented remarkably. These results indicated that deterministic processes played a more important role in determining the temporal dynamics of community composition while stochastic processes were more important for phylogenetic structure. Our findings further inform the development and design of appropriate restoration strategies, and provide insights into understanding the mechanisms regulating community assembly during the process of forest restoration.

AB No in-depth studies covering litter decomposition were previously conducted on afforested postmining sites despite the importance of litter decomposition on soil formation, especially in degraded areas. We aimed to compare leaf litter decomposition rates of 14 tree species growing in mixed stands on a postmining spoil heap, and to compare their decay rates with those obtained in pure stands of tree species that are very often planted in postmining areas. The study was conducted on the Belchatow Lignite Mine spoil heap, central Poland. We studied litter decomposition rates over 5 years using the litterbag method. Leaf litter decomposition rates (k constants; yr(-1)) after 5 years of the experiment were arranged from highest to lowest as follows: Prunus serotina (1.04), Alnus glutinosa (0.86), Fraxinus excelsior (0.81), Ulmus laevis (0.73), Acer pseudoplatanus (0.68), Populus tremula (0.63), Populus x canadensis (0.59), Betula pendula (0.54), Populus nigra 'Italica' (0.38), Quercus rubra (0.36), Pinus sylvestris (0.34), Robinia pseudoacacia (0.34), Fagus sylvatica (0.25), and Quercus robur (0.22). Decomposition rates increased with Mg, Ca, and summed Mg + Ca + P + K contents in freshly fallen leaves (%). All species-specific decomposition rates were higher in mixed than in Scots pine stands. Half of them were also higher than in pure stands of other tree species. Our results indicate that tree species composition could significantly affect the physiochemical properties of upper soil horizons on reclaimed areas. Based on these findings, we recommend planting high share of not only A. pseudoplatanus, A. glutinosa, and U. laevis but also F. sylvatica and Q. robur in stands on postmining spoil heaps, because mixed stands can accelerate soil development more than pure stands.

AB Soil nitrogen (N) accumulation enhances carbon (C) sequestration and subsequently the restoration of degraded ecosystems, but the changes in soil N properties after vegetation restoration in such ecosystems are poorly understood. We collected data from 358 fixed points in the karst catchment in China to determine the trends, magnitude, and mechanisms of soil N sequestration after 10 years of revegetation. The revegetation types were tillage fields that were abandoned or were converted to pasture, planted forest, or converted to mixed pasture and forest and pasture lands that were abandoned (P_Aban) or converted to mixed pasture and forest (P_Mix). The changes in soil N density (g m(-2)) over time were insignificant, and only P_Aban, P_ Mix, and the overall catchment experienced significant increases in soil N concentration (g kg(-1)). Structural equation modeling indicated that bedrock exposure affected the change in soil N concentration ( increment NC) and the soil N sequestration value ( increment ND) via affecting the change in soil C concentration, by directly affecting bulk density, soil depth, and Ca2+. The soil C:N ratio increased significantly, and the increase in soil N was slower than that of C, suggesting a decoupling of soil C and N accumulation in the initial stage of revegetation. increment ND was significantly related to the change in soil C:N ratio, indicating that the coupling between soil C and N may be constrained by insufficient soil N sequestration during revegetation. These findings suggest that the restoration of degraded karst ecosystems requires an increase in soil N input early during vegetation restoration.

AB Pure copper and Cu-Zn plates were friction stir welded under the same condition to evaluate the effect of stacking fault energy on the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of the joints. For this aim, microstructure and texture of the joints were systematically characterized by electron backscattered diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, to study the mechanical properties of the different microstructural zones of the joints, nanoindentation tests were employed. The results showed that in pure copper, continuous dynamic recrystallization was the only restoration mechanism for the formation of new grains. By adding zinc into copper, namely decreasing slacking fault energy, both continuous and discontinuous dynamic recryslallizalion mechanisms occurred. To this end, the enct of sucking fault energy on the restoration mechanisms has been summarized by schematic models. Moreover, the effect of the resloration mechanisms on the yield strength and strain hardening behavior of the joints has been scrutinized. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In karst ecosystems, plants absorbing smaller amounts of nutrients, owing to shallow soil, show limited growth. In addition, fine roots (diameter < 2 mm) contribute to the regulation of nutrient cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the spatial and temporal variations of fine root biomass in different vegetation types of the karst region remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the seasonal and vertical variation in biomass, necromass, and total mass of fine roots using sequential soil coring under different stages of vegetation restoration (grassland, shrubland, secondary forest, and primary forest) in Southwest China. The results showed that the fine root biomass and necromass ranged from 136.99 to 216.18 g m(-2) and 47.34 to 86.94 g m(-2), respectively. The total mass of fine roots and their production ranged from 187.00 to 303.11 g m(-2) and 55.74 to 100.84 g m(-2) year(-1), respectively. They showed a single peak across the vegetation restoration gradient. The fine root biomass and total fine root mass also showed a single peak with seasonal change. In autumn, the fine root biomass was high, whereas the necromass was low. Most of the fine roots were concentrated in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm), which accounted more than 57% root biomass, and decreased with increasing soil depth. In addition, fine root production showed a similar vertical pattern of variation with biomass. Overall, our results suggested that fine roots show clear seasonal and vertical changes with vegetation succession. Moreover, there was a higher seasonal fluctuation and a greater vertical decreasing trend in late-successional stages than in the early-successional stages. The conversion of degraded land to forest could improve the productivity of underground ecosystems and vegetation restoration projects in the fragile karst region should, therefore, continue.

AB These main goals of the restoration in distribution networks are to reenergise loads in the area where the power outage occurs. In this study, a new multi-stage restoration process by the aid of the decision-making tree algorithm is proposed to maximise the restored loads and also to minimise switching operations in the distribution networks with distributed generations (DGs). This method includes three stages of initial restoration, reconfiguration and optimal load shedding. In order to reduce the search space, the network switches are categorised into different sets which avoid moving to any inappropriate result space. The simulations are carried out on the 69-bus distribution system and the results show the high capability and accuracy of the proposed method in the restoration of distribution networks.

AB As a promising alternative to traditional treatment, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is being used to encourage hair growth through the release of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to hair restoration, PRP's multifactorial capabilities can also be used to treat aging skin, facial scarring, and acne. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the success of PRP in the field of dermatology, with specific attention to the role of PRP in hair restoration. Where possible, meta-analyses were used to evaluate the efficacy of PRP. In androgenetic alopecia (AGA) patients, 3 monthly PRP injections (1 session administered every month for 3 months) exhibited greater efficacy over placebo as measured by change in total hair density (hair/cm(2)) over the treatment period (mean difference: 25.61, 95% CI: 4.45 to 46.77; P = .02). The studies included in the meta-analysis used a half-head design, which may have influenced the results because of the effects PRP can induce. Controlled studies suggest that 2 to 4 sessions of PRP combined with traditional therapies and procedures can help minimize acne scarring and facial burns, improve aesthetic results, and decrease recovery time. However, data for these indications are lacking and are less robust in design. In conclusion, to achieve an improvement in hair restoration in patients with mild AGA, 3 initial monthly PRP injections should be given. Only upon completion of rigorous, randomized, controlled studies can standardized and effective PRP protocols for treating dermatology conditions such as acne scarring, facial burns, and aging skin be determined.

TI Roberge-Weiss endpoint and chiral symmetry restoration in N-f=2+1 QCD
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
ID STAGGERED FERMIONS; PHASE-DIAGRAM; DECONFINEMENT; TRANSITION
AB We investigate the fate of the Roberge-Weiss endpoint transition and its connection with the restoration of chiral symmetry as the chiral limit of N-f = 2 + 1 QCD is approached. We adopt a stout staggered discretization on lattices with N-t = 4 sites in the temporal direction; the chiral limit is approached maintaining a constant physical value of the strange-to-light mass ratio and exploring three different light quark masses, corresponding to pseudo-Goldstone pion masses m(pi) similar or equal to 100, 70 and 50 MeV around the transition. A finite size scaling analysis provides evidence that the transition remains second order, in the 3D Ising universality class, in all the explored mass range. The residual chiral symmetry of the staggered action also allows us to investigate the relation between the Roberge-Weiss endpoint transition and the chiral restoration transition as the chiral limit is approached: our results, including the critical scaling of the chiral condensate, are consistent with a coincidence of the two transitions in the chiral limit; however we are not able to discern the symmetry controlling the critical behavior, because the critical indices relevant to the scaling of the chiral condensate are very close to each other for the two possible universality classes [3D Ising or O(2)].

AB Objective: Assessment of long-term clinical data regarding post-endodontic restorations is essential for the evaluation of different post-and-core concepts. The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of patient self-reporting on post-endodontic restorations after 11 years of clinical service. Materials and methods: Twenty-nine patients (61 +/- 15 years old) with endodontic glass-fibre and titanium post-endodontic restorations were examined within the 11-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial. Restorations were assessed by self-reports during a telephone interview (one item), the completion of a four-item questionnaire and clinical and radiographic examination. A gold standard for restoration in situ or 'failure' was defined by clinical and radiographic examination. Diagnostic accuracy of patients' self-reports was evaluated by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV). Results: After a mean observation time of 137 months (min/max: 125/154 months), 25 (86.2%) restorations were in situ and 4 (13.8%) failures were detected. Self-report during a telephone interview and the four-item questionnaire correctly identified all in situ restorations (specificity = both 100%, NPV = 92.6%/96.2%). Self-report during a telephone interview identified two out of four failures (sensitivity = 50%, PPV = 100%), and self-report on the four-item questionnaire identified three out of four failures (sensitivity = 75%, PPV = 100%). Conclusions: When the clinical examination is not feasible, patients' self-report shows valuable diagnostic potential in the identification of the post-endodontic failure.

AB Phenotypic variation is critical for the long-term persistence of species and populations. Anthropogenic activities have caused substantial shifts and reductions in phenotypic variation across diverse taxa, but the underlying mechanism(s) (i.e., phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic evolution) and long-term consequences (e.g., ability to recover phenotypic variation) are unclear. Here we investigate the widespread and dramatic changes in adult migration characteristics of wild Chinook salmon caused by dam construction and other anthropogenic activities. Strikingly, we find an extremely robust association between migration phenotype (i.e., spring-run or fall-run) and a single locus, and that the rapid phenotypic shift observed after a recent dam construction is explained by dramatic allele frequency change at this locus. Furthermore, modeling demonstrates that continued selection against the spring-run phenotype could rapidly lead to complete loss of the spring-run allele, and an empirical analysis of populations that have already lost the spring-run phenotype reveals they are not acting as sustainable reservoirs of the allele. Finally, ancient DNA analysis suggests the spring-run allele was abundant in historical habitat that will soon become accessible through a large-scale restoration (i.e., dam removal) project, but our findings suggest that widespread declines and extirpation of the spring-run phenotype and allele will challenge reestablishment of the spring-run phenotype in this and future restoration projects. These results reveal the mechanisms and consequences of human-induced phenotypic change and highlight the need to conserve and restore critical adaptive variation before the potential for recovery is lost.

AB ObjectivesThe purpose of this systematic review was to compare the clinical performance of bulk-fill resin composites with conventional resin composites used for direct restorations of posterior teeth.MethodsThis review followed the PRISMA statement. This review was registered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42016053436). A search of the scientific literature was performed by two independent reviewers using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from commencement until January 2018. The research question was Do bulk-fill resin composites have a clinical performance comparable to conventional resin composites in posterior restorations? Only studies evaluating class I and II direct restorations in permanent teeth with a follow-up period of at least 1year were included. The RevMan 5 program was used for meta-analysis, calculating the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the dichotomous outcome (restoration failure or success).ResultsTen articles were selected, comprising 941 analyzed restorations. The mean follow-up period was 33.6months (12-72 months). No statistically significant differences in the failure rate were observed between conventional and base/flowable bulk-fill resin composites (p=0.31; RR 1.49; 95% CI 0.69-3.25) or full-body/sculptable bulk-fill resin composites (p=0.12; RR 1.89; 95% CI 0.84-4.24).ConclusionsThe present systematic review and meta-analysis indicate similar clinical performances of bulk-fill and conventional resin composites over a follow-up period of 12 to 72months.Clinical significanceBased on the results of this study, the bulk-fill resin composites could be an alternative for direct restorations in posterior teeth. However, clinical trials of longer duration are required.

AB ObjectivesThe aim of this ex-vivo study was to evaluate the impact of cavity size and glass-fiber post (GFP) placement on the load capability of endodontically treated maxillary incisors directly restored with resin composite.Materials and methodsNinety-six extracted human maxillary central incisors were endodontically treated and distributed to four groups (n=24): access cavity (A), access cavity and uni-proximal class III cavity (U), access cavity and bi-proximal class III cavity (B), and decoronated tooth (D). Specimens were restored with resin composite, and 12 specimen of each group received an adhesively placed glass-fiber post (P). Prior to linear loading, specimens were exposed to thermo-mechanical loading (TCML). Statistical analysis was performed using log-rank test after TCML, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test to compare load capabilities (F-max).ResultsSignificantly more failures occurred in group D for specimens without GFP during TCML (p=0.001). F-max (mean (SD) in N was (A) 513 (124), (AP) 554 (201), (U) 438 (171), (UP) 537 (232) (B) 483 (219), (BP) 536 (281), D 143 (181), and DP 500 (331), and differed significantly among groups (p=0.003). Pair-wise comparison revealed lower F-max values for group D compared to all other groups (p<0.034) except group DP.ConclusionsEndodontically treated maxillary central incisors with cavity sizes up to bi-proximal class III may be successfully directly restored with resin composite. Post placement shows no additional effect except for decoronated endodontically treated incisors.Clinical relevanceEndodontically treated incisors with access cavities to class III cavities can be successfully restored with resin composite. Post placement for decoronated ETT is recommended.

AB Rapid modernization has brought about massive changes in the urban and rural landscapes of China. While many old places and ancient buildings have been pulled down and replaced with more modern alternatives, others have been protected and restored. These include ancient ancestral temples, an important cultural space in China. Previous research has shown how different level governments and rural communities work together to restore ancient temples, but didn't bring to light artistic and non-government financed and patronized cases of restoration projects. This article adopts a bottom-up perspective to examine a case in Guangzhou how an individual artist transforms an ancient ancestral temple into a new cultural space. Through an ethnographic-style exploration of the practice of restoration, we unfold the interconnections between an individual's social memory of the past, their love of place, and their enthusiasm for restoration work. Differing from the government's standardized' and functionalist restoration of ancestral temples, this case study shows an individual's emotional and material devotion to transforming a neglected ancestral temple into an eclectic cultural space where the art works are a result of freedom of creative expression.

TI Comparison of Failure and Complication Risks of Porcelain Laminate and
   Indirect Resin Veneer Restorations: A Meta-Analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS
ID CERAMIC VENEERS; CLINICAL-PERFORMANCE; SURVIVAL; COMPOSITE; ENAMEL;
   TRIAL
AB Purpose: To evaluate and compare the failure and complication risks of porcelain laminate and indirect resin veneer restorations (VRs) by means of a meta-analysis. Methods: An electronic database search was performed in MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (Ovid), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases, and a gray literature search was performed on OpenGrey. All database searches were completed by March 2018. Two authors individually screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality and risk of bias of the included studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (CHSRI). The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to synthesize the data of the included studies. All statistical analyses were performed using the software Stata 14.0, and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Five studies-two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three clinical controlled trials (CCTs)-were included in this review. Of the three CCTs, two were assessed to be low quality, and the third was considered high quality. The two RCTs were rated as unclear risk of bias. The meta-analysis results showed the risk of failure for indirect resin VRs was higher than for porcelain laminate VRs (RR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.06-0.40; P =.000). Fracture and debonding were the main complications leading to failure. For risk of fracture, an RR of 0.18 (95% CI: 0.04-0.71) and a statistically significant difference (P =.015) were found in favor of porcelain laminate VRs. For risk of debonding, there was no statistically significant difference (P =.108) found between the two types of VRs. The results of the sensitivity analysis (RR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.02-0.45; P =.004) suggested that this conclusion was reliable. Conclusion: The survival rate of porcelain laminate VRs was higher than indirect resin VRs, and the latter had a higher risk of fracture. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of debonding between the two types of VRs. Porcelain laminate VRs have a better prognosis compared to indirect resin VRs, which provides an evidence-based reference for the selection of VRs in clinical practice.

AB We consider a class of non-Lipschitz regularization problems that include the TVp model as a special case. A lower bound theory of the non-Lipschitz regularization is obtained, which inspires us to propose an algorithm guaranteeing the non-expansiveness of the images gradient support set. After being proximally linearized, this algorithm can be easily implemented. Some standard techniques in image processing, like the fast Fourier transform, could be utilized. The global convergence is also established. Moreover, we prove that the restorations by the algorithm have edge preservation property. Numerical examples are given to show good performance of the algorithm and the rationality of the theories.

   Introduction to the 2001 Ecological Conceptual Planning and a Review of
   its Implementation
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR SPATIAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
DE Ecological Planning; Conceptual Planning; Planning Implementation; Water
   Environment Restoration; West Lake in Hangzhou
AB In China, at the beginning of the 21st century, conceptual planning became a popular type of strategic planning. However, it tended to address issues more relevant to development opportunities, industrial structures and spatial layouts, rather than the ideas of environment and ecology. Instead, Tongji University's conceptual planning for the West Lake in Hangzhou, proposed in 2001, focused on the restoration of water environments. It regarded environmental improvement as a precondition for further development of tourism and the economy. Although this plan did not win the bid at the time, the lake's ecological restoration from then onward incorporated all of its proposed concepts. As a result, the lake's ecosystem has been restored successfully. This paper introduces the plan, discusses its main ideas and contextually reflects upon the implementation of conceptual ecological planning. In addition to the need to be connected to development actions or statutory planning, relying on adequate multidisciplinary technical support and rationally addressing local development contributes to best practices for ecological conceptual planning.

AB This article describes a workflow based on a top-down approach to provide a fixed-type immediate interim restoration after placing a single implant using a digitally driven surgical guide and a matrix-positioning device. A characteristic of the technique is that both the surgical guide and the matrix-positioning device are fabricated from a single diagnostic virtual trial restoration designed on computer-aided design (CAD) software. This workflow may shorten the time required for chairside placement of an interim restoration and enhance esthetics when rehabilitating anterior teeth.

AB Statement of problem. The decision to splint or to restore independently generally occurs during the planning stage, when the advantages and disadvantages of each clinical situation are considered based on the proposed treatment. However, clinical evidence to help clinicians make this decision is lacking.
   Purpose. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the marginal bone loss, implant survival rate, and prosthetic complications of splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations.
   Material and methods. This study was designed according to the Cochrane criteria for elaborating a systematic review and meta-analysis and adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Also, this review was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42017080162). An electronic search in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases was conducted up to November 2017. A specific clinical question was structured according to the population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) approach. The addressed focused question was "Should the restoration of adjacent implants be splinted or nonsplinted?" The meta-analysis was based on the Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance methods to assess the marginal bone loss, implant survival, and prosthetic complications of splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations.
   Results. Nineteen studies were selected for qualitative and quantitative analyses. A total of 4215 implants were placed in 2185 patients (splinted, 2768; nonsplinted, 1447); the mean follow-up was 87.8 months (range=12-264 months). Quantitative analysis found no significant differences between splinted and nonsplinted restorations for marginal bone loss. The assessed studies reported that 75 implants failed (3.4%), of which 24 were splinted (99.1% of survival rate) and 51 were nonsplinted (96.5% of survival rate). Quantitative analysis of all studies showed statistically significant higher survival rates for splinted restorations than for nonsplinted restorations. Ceramic chipping, screw loosening, abutment screw breakage, and soft tissue inflammation were reported in the selected studies. The quantitative analysis found no statistically significant difference in the prosthetic complications of splinted and nonsplinted restorations.
   Conclusions. Within the limitations of this systematic review and meta-analysis, it was concluded that there was no difference in the marginal bone loss and prosthetic complications of splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations; this is especially true for restorations in the posterior region. However, splinted restorations were associated with decreased implant failure.

TI Integrating kinematic restoration and forward finite element simulations
   to constrain the evolution of salt diapirism and overburden deformation
   in evaporite basins
SO JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY
ID GULF-OF-MEXICO; ROCK-SALT; STRAIN RATES; STRESS; WATER; TECTONICS;
   CREEP; BANDS; SANDSTONE; STATE
AB In evaporite basins, salt deformation including inflation, diapirism, and salt canopy emplacement is inherently non-coaxial and ductile and thus it presents challenges for two-dimensional kinematic restorations that rely on line-length and area-balancing assumptions. Also, because salt flow and the resulting deformation of adjacent cover units can be driven by temporally and spatially transient salt pressure gradients, kinematic restorations are generally unable to predict the magnitude and distribution of subseismic deformation that results from a particular structural scenario. Here, we use a case study from the Atwater fold belt, Gulf of Mexico, to test a new workflow that involves comparison of kinematic restoration models with forward numerical (finite-element) models of structural evolution to examine the physical validity of solutions derived from the kinematic restorations and to determine the nature and spatial distribution of the resultant subseismic deformation. In the Atwater fold belt, which represents the downdip portion of a linked updip (landward) extensional-downdip (seaward) contractional system, our kinematic restorations indicated that major anticlines likely result from early short wavelength folding followed by (1) inflation of the autochthonous salt to drive failure of the overburden, (2) collapse of the updip limb of the major salt-cored anticline as the salt evacuates updip, and (3) rapid emplacement of the allochthonous salt canopy. In margin scale finite element models of the same system, progradation of the sedimentary wedge above the weak salt substrate leads to basinward migration of the salt and produces inflation of the major downdip salt-cored folds, as predicted by the kinematic model. However, in relatively strong overburden materials (equivalent friction angle = 32 degrees), such salt flow only sustains inflation of the anticlines and is unable to reproduce the interpreted collapse of the anticlinal backlimb or emplacement of the salt canopy. Alternate model runs that include a significant reduction in material strength (equivalent friction angle = 18 degrees) allow salt in the anticlinal crest to drive both reactive and active diapirism and ultimately lead to rapid emplacement of allochthonous canopies. In all of these models, diapirism drives substantial seismically-resolvable and subseismic deformation of wall rocks. Additionally, these models clearly show that the stress field, and particularly the K value (horizontal-vertical stress ratio) of the sediments adjacent to salt structures used for estimating stress magnitudes for drilling predictions, is fundamentally dependent on what point along the evolutionary path from autochthonous salt, to diapir, to salt sheet, that each structure resides. These results highlight the need to test complex kinematic restorations with physics-based techniques. Additionally, they demonstrate that integrating kinematic restorations with these finite element solutions can substantially increase our ability to predict both subseismic reservoir damage in sediments adjacent to salt structures and the K values used for forecasting drilling conditions, particularly in young basins filled with poorly consolidated sediments.

TI Soil constraints for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spore community in

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
DE Campo rupestre; Cerrado; Glomeromycetes; Microbial community;
   Restoration ecology
ID RHIZOSPHERE MICROBIOME; FIELDS; GROWTH; ROOTS; AREAS
AB The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important organisms with enormous potential for use in ecological restoration due to their positive association to seedlings. We evaluated the effects of soil degradation on a species-rich AMF community that could hinder the restoration of rupestrian grassland sites whose soil had been removed. Soil samples were taken from reference and degraded sites. We assessed the density, species richness, and composition of AMF, as well as soil macronutrients, metals, and texture. We found lower AMF density and richness in degraded than in reference sites. AMF community seemed to be negatively affected by a low level of potassium (K) and a higher concentration of heavy metals and day in degraded sites. Besides the shifts in AMF composition associated mainly with K concentration, we found that the lack of this nutrient in degraded sites was also related to a significant reduction in density of AMF species, which are thought to play important roles in plant development and, therefore, in ecological restoration. Thus, we emphasize that efforts to restore degraded areas of rupestrian grassland should contemplate the reestablishment of soil physical and chemical properties, such as a lower clay concentration, and levels of nutrients that are key for AMF colonization. In addition, we suggest the further development of protocols for inoculation of seedlings and soil with AMF species to improve the success of replantation.

AB Quantitative approaches are needed for assessing assisted recovery potential in degraded coral reefs. A lagoonal community (Bolinao, Philippines) that has experienced severe disturbances (overfishing, blast fishing and coral bleaching) in the past was observed for 26 months. Benthic state sequences in 4 x 4 cm patches were used to quantify monthly probabilities of transitions between reef states. Benthic cover distribution was consistent with a spatially heterogeneous Markov process, with high variability in transition probabilities within a subset of four states: crustose algae with cropped turf, the codominant sponge Callyspongia samarensis, articulated coralline algae and fleshy macroalgae (MA). Once a patch is dominated by any of these states, there is high likelihood of cycling within the set before escaping to the rarer invertebrate groups. The assemblage is unlikely to recover naturally given prevailing conditions. Patches dominated by juvenile and adult corals have mean turnover times of about 3 and 5 months, respectively, due to (partial) mortality and competition. Asymmetry was detected for coral-macroalgal competition, despite low fleshy algal cover (9.5%), that was more adverse for coral juveniles than adults. While competition between coral and the mat-forming C. samarensis was symmetrical, loss of coral cover through this path is relatively higher as a result of the higher interaction frequency. Articulated coralline algae do not appear as a constraint. Complementary strategies for assisted recovery were inferred from successional indices as well as the sensitivity of stationary coral cover to changes in transition probabilities. Results demonstrate that short-term, fine-scale observations of state variables can be used to resolve biotic constraints to inform restoration initiatives.

AB Conifer encroachment in sagebrush ecosystems reduces habitat heterogeneity, niche space, and resource availability, all of which negatively affect many wildlife populations. Sagebrush restoration is recommended as a management action to mitigate conifer encroachment and restore wildlife across millions of hectares in the Great Basin. Despite this recommendation, the effects of conifer encroachment and sagebrush restoration are unknown for most wildlife species. Small nonvolant mammal communities include keystone species, consumers and prey; facilitate energy flow and ecological function; and provide important ecological goods and services. We assessed causal relationships between conifer encroachment and sagebrush restoration (conifer removal and seeding native plants) on small mammal communities over 11 yr using a Before-After-Control-Impact design. Sagebrush habitat supported an additional small mammal species, twice the biomass, and nearly three times higher densities than conifer-encroached habitat. Sagebrush restoration increased shrub cover, decreased tree cover, and density but failed to increase native herbaceous plant density. Restoration caused a large increase in the non-native, invasive annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.). Counter to prediction, small mammal diversity did not increase in response to sagebrush restoration, but restoration maintained small mammal density in the face of ongoing conifer encroachment. Pinon mice (Peromyscus truei), woodland specialists with highest densities in conifer-encroached habitat, were negatively affected by sagebrush restoration. Increasing cheatgrass due to sagebrush restoration may not negatively impact small mammal diversity, provided cheatgrass density and cover do not progress to a monoculture and native vegetation is maintained. The consequences of conifer encroachment, a long-term, slow-acting impact, far outweigh the impacts of sagebrush restoration, a short-term, high-intensity impact, on small mammal diversity. Given the ecological importance of small mammals, maintenance of small mammal density is a desirable outcome for sagebrush restoration.

A wide range of image restoration methods exists, yet feasibility of these methods in portable platforms is not guaranteed due to limited hardware resources on such platforms. The paper addresses this problem by focusing on denoising algorithms. We have chosen two representatives of denoising methods with state-of-the-art performance, and propose different parallel implementations and algorithmic simplifications suitable for mobile phones. In addition, an extension to resolution enhancement is presented including both visual and quantitative comparisons. Analysis of the algorithms is carried out with respect to the computation time, power consumption and output image quality.

Based on preliminary investigations and model repairs, the planning had to take into account, on the one hand, the building and transport requirements for an inner-city transport link. On the other hand, during the repair, the construction and ornamental elements had to be adequately preserved from the construction period between 1135 and 1146 to the first renovation phases to the destruction of war and traffic facilities. The article provides an overview of the preliminary investigations, the planning and their boundary conditions, as well as the resulting repair work on a still used transport structure, which is part of the monument ensemble of the historic old town.

TI Incorporating Wind Energy in Power System Restoration Planning

DE Integer L-shaped algorithm; mixed-integer linear programming; power
   system restoration; stochastic optimization; wind uncertainty
AB Wind energy is rapidly growing. While wind brings us clean and inexpensive energy, its inherent variability and uncertainty present challenges for the power grid. In particular, employing wind energy for power system restoration is very challenging. A fast and reliable restoration plays a vital role to achieve the self-healing power grid. This paper develops a novel offline restoration planning tool for harnessing wind energy to enhance grid resilience. The wind-for-restoration problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming problem with generated wind energy scenarios. The problem is then decomposed into two stages and solved with the integer L-shaped algorithm. Numerical experiments have been conducted through different case studies using the modified IEEE 57-bus system. The developed tool can provide the scheduled wind power at each restoration time. The impact of wind energy is investigated from the aspects of location and inertia capability, as well as wind penetration, fluctuation, and uncertainty. Moreover, a dynamic response validation tool is developed to validate the results of optimization problem in a dynamic simulation software. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal wind harnessing strategy can help improve system restoration process and enhance system resilience.

ID POWER; MICROGRIDS; CHALLENGES
AB During a major outage in a secondary network distribution system, distributed generators (DGs) connected to the primary feeders as well as the secondary network can be used to serve critical loads. This paper proposed a resilience-oriented method to determine restoration strategies for secondary network distribution systems after a major disaster. Technical issues associated with the restoration process are analyzed, including the operation of network protectors, inrush currents caused by the energization of network transformers, synchronization of DGs to the network, and circulating currents among IX:s. A look-ahead load restoration framework is proposed, incorporating technical issues associated with secondary networks, limits on DG capacity and generation resources, dynamic constraints, and operational limits. The entire outage duration is divided into a sequence of periods. Restoration strategies can be adjusted at the beginning of each period using the latest information. Numerical simulation of the modified IEEE 342-node low voltage networked test system is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
DE Clinical evaluation; Dental restoration failure; Longevity
ID COLOR STABILITY; LONGEVITY; SHRINKAGE; SILORANE; TEETH
AB Introduction: The search for restorative materials with clinical longevity has led to modifications in the composition of the resin composites.
   Aim: To evaluate the clinical performance and the occlusal wear of posterior restorations with one microhybrid (Suprafill/SS White) and two condensable/packable (Filtek P60/3MESPE and Surefil/Dentsply Caulk) resin composites.
   Materials and Methods: Sixty restorations (n=20) were performed in 2002 in 20 patients. Class I and II cavities were restored with the studied resin composites in a split-mouth design. Evaluations were done at baseline, 1 and 14-years regarding colour stability, marginal discolouration and integrity, caries incidence, and anatomic form according to the USPHS criteria (United States Public Health Service). OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images of the gypsum replica were analysed to observe the wear of the restorations at the buccal and lingual cusps. Data was evaluated through Friedman's test and Wilcoxon signed ranks post hoc test (p=0.05).
   Results: Differences were not observed between the evaluated resin composites regarding each of the analysed parameters (p>0.05). However, for each resin composite, differences were observed between the observation periods through Friedman's test (p<0.001), except for caries incidence. Differences were observed when the 14-year data for colour match, anatomic form and marginal adaptation was compared. After 14 years, Surefil presented lower unsatisfactory evaluations when compared to the other groups (only two). No significant differences were found between the buccal and lingual cusps (p>0.05).
   Conclusion: The condensable/packable resin composites and microhybrid presented similar performance after 14 years. The cast replica analysis by OCT was a viable method for follow-up evaluations consistent with the clinical observations.

AB Various microRNAs (miRNA) have been recognized potential novel tumor markers and have a critical role in cancer development and progression. Recently, methylation of miRNA-148a was identified as a crucial biochemical process in the progression of cancer. However, its potential role and in pancreatic cancer as well as the underlying mechanisms have remained largely elusive. The present study investigated the potential antitumor effect of miR-148a as well as its impact on invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. It was found that the expression of miRNA-148a and the potential predictive biomarker maternally expressed gene-3 (MEG-3) were obviously decreased in human pancreatic cancer tissues compared with those in adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Furthermore, miR-148a was found to be downregulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with normal pancreatic cells through promoter methylation. An MTT assay and a clonogenic assay demonstrated that restoration of miRNA-148a inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, miR-148a transduction led to the upregulation of MEG-3 expression and promoted apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. Western blot analysis revealed that transduction of miR-148a markedly decreased the expression levels of C-myc, cyclin D1 and -catenin in pancreatic cancer cells. Methylation of miR-148a not only decreased the endogenous -catenin levels but also inhibited the nuclear translocation of -catenin to delay cell cycle progression. Furthermore, ectopic miR-148a methylation inhibited pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion via causing an upregulation of MEG-3 expression. Most importantly, ectopic overexpression of miR-148a in pancreatic cancer cells inhibited tumor formation in an animal experiment. Taken together, miR-148a methylation is a crucial regulatory process to inhibit the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, and transduction of miR-148a suppressed the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells through negative regulation of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. The findings of the present study suggested that miRNA-148a acts as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer and may contribute to the development of novel treatments for pancreatic cancer.

AB Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have attracted broad attention as a novel approach for using economic incentives to provide ecosystem services more sustainably. However, there have been inadequate efforts ad- dressing the basic question of how to design and execute PES at the program level. By comparing and contrasting the experiences of restoring degraded cropland to forest and grass covers in China and the U.S., this paper aims to tackle that question and provide some valuable and timely policy insights that can inform China and other countries of how to improve the performance of their PES programs in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and/or equity. Our analysis will unfold through examining such specific question as: What are the socioeconomic and environmental backgrounds for one country to launch a large PES program? How was it designed initially and has evolved over time? How has its performance been evaluated and what are the main outcomes? How likely is it for the enrolled land to be reconverted or for the contract to be expired? What are the primary challenges to its long-term success? Finally, this study calls for a more practical and focused approach to PES design, implementation, and evaluation that will lead to improved outcomes of forest and grassland ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation.

AB Species composition is a vital attribute of any ecosystem. Accordingly, ecological restoration often has the original, or "natural," species composition as its target. However, we still lack adequate methods for predicting the expected time to compositional recovery in restoration studies. We describe and explore a new, ordination regression-based approach (ORBA) for predicting time to recovery that allows both linear and asymptotic (logarithmic) relationships of compositional change with time. The approach uses distances between restored plots and reference plots along the successional gradient, represented by a vector in ordination space, to predict time to recovery. Thus, the approach rests on three requirements: (a) the general form of the relationship between compositional change and time must be known; (b) a sufficiently strong successional gradient must be present and adequately represented in a species compositional dataset; and (c) a restoration target must be specified. We tested the approach using data from a boreal old-growth forest that was followed for 18 years after experimental disturbance. Data from the first 9 years after disturbance were used to develop models, the subsequent 9 years for validation. Rates of compositional recovery in the example dataset followed the general pattern of decrease with time since disturbance. Accordingly, linear models were too optimistic about the time to recovery, whereas the asymptotic models provided more precise predictions. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that the new approach opens for reliable prediction of recovery rates and time to recovery using species compositional data. Moreover, it allows us to assess whether recovery proceeds in the desired direction and to quantitatively compare restoration speed, and hence effectiveness, between alternative management options.

AB Peat-forming wetlands, particularly floating fens that form the initial stages of these ecosystems, are declining globally due to excavation, dehydration and eutrophication. Restoration typically involves reestablishment of early-successional open-water stages, with oligotrophic conditions that are characteristic for these systems. However, restoration success is notoriously limited. A potential improvement may be to initiate succession by reintroducing of target plant species. Knowledge is therefore needed on (a) which plant functional groups should be re-introduced to stimulate fen formation; and (b) how to manage nutrient levels during restoration, considering that plant growth may be slow in oligotrophic conditions. We hypothesized that increasing functional diversity of introduced species would stimulate the formation of peat-forming target communities, their biomass accumulation and expansion onto open water. We also hypothesized that nutrient availability would mediate the relative contribution of specific functional groups to these effects. We investigated this in 36 artificial outdoor ponds by manipulating plant functional diversity (clonal dominants, clonal stress-tolerators and interstitials) on constructed rafts with fen-forming communities, and subjected these to a range of nutrient loadings over 2 years. Increasing functional diversity as well as increasing nutrient loadings had stimulating effects on plant biomass accumulation, cover formation and rhizome growth onto open water. Both complementarity (due to niche partitioning or facilitation) and selection effects were mechanisms underlying the diversity effect, with a constant relative importance over the entire range of nutrient availabilities. Different functional groups were important for biomass production at different nutrient availabilities. Rhizome formation by clonal stress-tolerators contributed disproportionately to open water colonization, identifying this functional group as key across all nutrient levels. Synthesis and applications. Restoration of floating fen communities can be stimulated during the first 2 years by introducing a high functional diversity of plant species. These include fast-growing clonal species, clonal stress-tolerators and interstitials, which facilitate each other. Restoration is dependent on the presence of clonal stress-tolerators such as Calla palustris, Comarum palustre and Menyanthes trifoliata for expansion onto the open water. Furthermore, restoration can start under a wide range of water nutrient levels, including eutrophic conditions.

AB Landscape-scale restoration requires stakeholder collaboration and recognition of diverse social and ecological motivations to achieve multiple benefits. Yet few landscape restoration projects have set and achieved shared social and ecological goals. Mechanisms to integrate social and ecological motivations will differ in different landscapes. We provide examples from urban, agricultural, and mined landscapes to highlight how integration can achieve multiple benefits and help incentivize restoration. Better communication of ecological and especially social benefits of restoration could increase motivation. Social and economic incentives from carbon markets are evident in agricultural landscapes, biodiversity offset schemes are unlikely to motivate restoration without proof-of-concept, and framing restoration in terms of ecosystem services shows promise. Synthesis and applications. When setting restoration goals, it is important to recognize the diverse motivations that influence them. In doing so, and by evaluating both social and ecological benefits, we can better achieve desired restoration outcomes. Customizing incentives to cater for diverse stakeholder motivations could therefore encourage restoration projects.

AB Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the internal adaptation of resin composite restorations in Class I cavities with or without an intermediate layer, and to identify the relationships between the internal adaptation and the polymerization shrinkage parameters of the layer material.
   Methods: Class I cavities prepared in human third molars were treated with a one-step self-etch adhesive (G-Premio Bond, GC). In the control group, Tetric-EvoCeram Bulk-Fill (TBF, Ivoclar Vivadent) was placed using the bulk-fill technique and then light-cured. In the experimental groups, six different layer materials (three flowable resin composites, two bulk-fill resin composites, and a resin-modified glass-ionomer) were applied to a 1.5-mm thickness and light-cured, which was followed by TBF filling. After thermo-cycling, internal adaptation was measured using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging and compared in terms of high brightness percentage (HB%) to represent the microgap. Shrinkage strain (SS), flexural modulus (FM), and polymerization shrinkage stress of the intermediate layer-resin composite complex (PS) were measured for each material. The relationships among HB%, SS, FM, and PS were evaluated statistically.
   Results: Groups with an intermediate layer showed lower HB% than the control group. The HB% correlated with PS (Pearson's correlation: R-2 = 0.883, p < 0.05), and the PS correlated with the product of SS and FM.
   Conclusion: Internal adaptation depended on the polymerization shrinkage stress of the intermediate layer-resin composite complex.
   Clinical significance: Bulk-fill resin composite, which can show low polymerization shrinkage stress, may be used as an intermediate layer for better internal adaptation.

AB Cartilage restoration procedures appear to be increasing in popularity and are being performed more frequently for older patients according to a recent analysis of database data. Chondroplasty and microfracture are most commonly performed; however, chondrocyte transfer procedures, including osteochondral autologous transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation, are being performed more commonly. Relatively few corrective osteotomies are being performed in conjunction with these procedures; this is concerning because surgeons are either not looking for malalignment or not correcting it.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the current status of advanced cartilage restoration procedures among newly trained orthopaedic surgeons in the United States. Methods: The American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery database was queried to identify all advanced cartilage restoration procedure cases submitted by American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery part II board certification examination candidates from 2003 to 2015. All documented autologous chondrocyte implantation, autologous osteochondral transfer, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and marrow stimulation techniques (MSTs) procedures were analyzed. Analysis was performed to describe trends in annual incidence, types of complications, concomitant procedures, and geographical differences in incidence of advanced cartilage procedures. Results: From 2003 to 2015, a total of 2,827 surgeons submitted 7,522 cartilage restoration procedures, with 7,060 cases documented as MST (80.01%). The number of cartilage cases decreased significantly from 2003 to in 2015 (P < .001), with MST having the largest decline (P < .001). The incidence of open osteochondral allograft transplantation (odds ratio = 1.35; P = .023) and open autologous osteochondral transfer (odds ratio = 0.84; P = .004) increased over the study period. Overall, the majority of patients (57.0%) were male; however, female patients were on average significantly older than male patients (P < .001). Cartilage procedures were performed concomitantly with a realignment osteotomy procedure in 1.7% of cases. The incidence of surgical complications increased throughout the study period from 2.9% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2015 (P < .001). Conclusions: Cartilage restoration procedures, specifically MSTs, are being decreasingly performed among recently trained orthopaedic surgeons. In contrast, complication rates have been increasing since 2003, demonstrating a possible paradigm shift toward more complex cartilage procedures, specifically osteochondral grafting procedures.

CAD-CAM ceramic blocks were used to shape 0.3 mm and 1.5 mm thick discs, corresponding to: feldspathic (F), 64 GPa; lithium disilicate (L), 95 GPa; and Yttrium-partially stabilized tetragonal zirconia (Y-TZP) (Y), 209.3 GPa. The 0.3 mm discs were arranged in 4 layers cemented with resin cement (Multilink N), and the 1.5 mm discs were not treated, in such a way that the final thickness of all specimens was 1.5 mm (+/- 0.15 mm). The following 6 groups were tested: F (F: monolithic); L (L: monolithic); LLFF (L + L + F + F); FFLL (F + F + L + L); YLFF (Y + L + F + F); YLLF (Y + L + L + F). The loads-to-fracture were obtained using the biaxial flexural strength test until failure and the data were run using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons (alpha = 0.05) tests. The biaxial bending test was also simulated through finite element analysis (FEA) to identify the tensile stress generated at each layer of the groups. Mean fatigue failure load (100,000 cycles; 20 Hz) was determined using the staircase approach. The fracture analysis was performed by stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy.
   Results. The load to fracture (N) were obtained as follows: L (592.9 +/- 73.8)(D) > FFLL (319.78 +/- 43.59)(C) > YLLF (246.75 +/- 24.89)(B) > F (167.13 +/- 9.84)(A) > YLFF (166.51 +/- 15.24)(A) > LLFF (165.46 +/- 22.75)(A); and the fatigue failure load (N): L (310.92 +/- 26.73)(F) > FFLL (190.17 +/- 8.32)(E) > F (106.21 +/- 2.81)(D) > YLLF (96.48 +/- 5.73)(C) > YLFF (89.56 +/- 2.38)(B) > LLFF (77.23 +/- 6.33)(A). The origin of all of the tested specimens was located at the tensile region of the discs, as encountered in FEA.
   Significance. The material under tensile stress is determinant for the restoration's strength and the adhesive interface negatively influenced the mechanical behavior of the multilayer structures. (C) 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article methodically gathers concepts and findings from related disciplines to propose that there is a fundamental, disorder-specific psychological impairment, which defines Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as etiologically different from simple PTSD. This impairment is a flawed working model for restoration of trust when one partner fears betrayal. This working model is legacy of childhood relationships with manipulative caretakers who kept the child powerless to test the trustworthiness of their reasons to break promises and to fail the child's expectations. Manipulative caretakers invert the respective roles and responsibilities for restoration of trust, which constitutes perversion of intimacy. This article describes how that fundamental flaw becomes the cause of patients' disorder, by episodically rendering them powerless to ascertain a perception of grave betrayal as true or false in later relationships. Repeated failure with experiments for certainty about others' love explains the characteristic personality traits and beliefs of persons with Complex PTSD, i.e., cynicism about the world's benevolence, self-derogation and sense of a foreshortened future. This article closes with reference to a study that investigated the efficacy of a crisis intervention designed to remediate this fundamental impairment.

AB The abnormal occlusal contact can disrupt the coordination and health of the oral jaw system. Therefore, the dynamic adjustment of the occlusal surface is of great significance for assessing the status of occlusal contact and clarifying jaw factors of stomatognathic system diseases. To solve this problem, a trajectory subtraction algorithm based on screw theory to improve the accuracy of the occlusal movement trajectory is proposed in our paper. Driving by the relative trajectory, a virtual dynamic occlusal adjustment system is developed to realize 3D occlusal movement simulating, automatic occluding relation detection, and automatic occlusal adjustment. Furthermore, we adapt an active occlusal adjustment method based on Laplacian deformation to increase the contact areas of the occlusal surface, which can aid dentists to realize the automatic adjustment of the non-interference regions. As a consequence, the proposed subtraction algorithm is feasible and the root-mean-square is 0.097mm, and the adjusted occlusal surface is more consistent with the natural occlusal morphology.

AB Wetlands in urban and urbanizing areas are often smaller, more degraded, and subject to more stressors than those in undeveloped locations. Their restored level of functioning may never equal that of a site in an undisturbed landscape. Yet, the social benefits from restoring these wetlands may be significant because of the relative scarcity of wetlands and natural areas in urban settings and also the large number of people who may benefit. In this study, we have outlined a systematic approach to compiling nonmonetary indicators of wetlands restoration benefits: The Rapid Benefit Indicators (RBI) Approach. The RBI approach is grounded in economic theory and compatible with methods used by environmental economists to value ecosystem services. We illustrate the RBI approach with a comparison of 2 sites within the Woonasquatucket River Watershed in Rhode Island. As an urbanizing watershed, the Woonasquatucket illustrates how decisions may differ when based primarily on evaluations of ecological functioning versus those that incorporate benefits to people. It demonstrates how small urban sites with relatively low ecological function can provide large social benefits. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:148-159. Published 2018.

TI Critical Load Restoration Using Distributed Energy Resources for
   Resilient Power Distribution System
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
DE Distributed energy resources (DERs); restoration; resilience; mixed
   integer linear programming; availability
AB Extreme weather events have a significant impact on the aging and outdated power distribution infrastructures. These high-impact low-probability events often result in extended outages and loss of critical services, thus, severely affecting customers' safety. This calls for the need to ensure the resilience in distribution networks by quickly restoring the critical services during a disaster. This paper presents an advanced feeder restoration method to restore critical loads using distributed energy resources (DERs). A resilient restoration approach is proposed that jointly maximizes the amount of restored critical loads and optimizes the restoration times by optimally allocating grids available DER resources. The restoration problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program with the objective of maximizing the resilience to postrestoration failures while simultaneously satisfying grids critical connectivity and operational constraints and ensuring a radial operation for a given open-loop feeder configuration. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the IEEE 123-node feeder with five DERs supplying 11 critical loads and the IEEE 906-bus feeder with three DERs supplying 17 critical loads. The impacts of DER availability and fuel reserve on restored networks are assessed and it is shown that the proposed approach is successfully able to restore a maximum number of critical loads using available DERs.

ID POWER; IDENTIFICATION; PLACEMENT
AB Power system operators are facing major challenges today to keep the system operating at the admissible limits. Recent blackouts demonstrated the need for a systematic study and design of a comprehensive system control strategy. Intentional controlled islanding (ICI) has been proposed as an effective corrective control action of final resort to save the system from a partial or a complete blackout. ICI limits the occurrence and consequences of blackouts by splitting the power system into a group of smaller, stable, and sustainable subsystems, also called islands. After a controlled system separation, power system operators should resynchronize and reconnect each island to restore the system. In this sense, real-time knowledge of the operating condition of the islands is required. In this paper, a real-time ICI and restoration scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme consists of an ICI algorithm that finds islanding solutions with minimal power-flow disruption while considering power system restoration constraints (e.g., blackstart availability, sufficient generation capacity, and observability), a real-time state estimator that monitors the system before and after the islanding, and a restoration process. The proposed ICI and restoration scheme is tested using the dynamic IEEE 39- and 118-bus test systems.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
DE Microgrids; mobile emergency resources; distribution system; critical
   service restoration; resilience
ID ADEQUACY
AB The existing microgrid-based distribution system restoration methods follow traditional restoration criteria, which achieve a maximum coverage of distribution systems. In extreme conditions (e.g., natural disasters and physical and cyber attacks), the traditional restoration plans could pose additional financial and security risks to local utility customers. That is, restored services could be further interrupted by subsequent outages in the extended event. To address such resilience challenges, this paper proposes the formation of adaptive multimicrogrids as part of the critical service restoration strategy. The proposed strategy comprises microgrid formation (MF) and load switching sequence (LSS) steps. The MF forms multiple microgrids with minimum overall scale and radial or looped topologies and includes optimally positioned mobile emergency resources to address potential risks in extreme conditions. The LSS determines a proper load switching sequence for ensuring the system dynamic performance in the restoration process. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by a case study on the IEEE 132-node test feeder system and the time-domain simulation in MATLAB Simulink.

AB Prolonged exposure to high levels of glucose and fatty acid (FFA) can induce tissue damage commonly referred to as glucolipotoxicity and is particularly harmful to pancreatic beta-cells. Glucolipotoxicity-mediated beta-cell failure is a critical causal factor in the late stages of diabetes, which suggests that mechanisms that prevent or reverse beta-cell death may play a critical role in the treatment of the disease. Transcription factor PDX1 was recently reported to play a key role in maintaining beta-cell function and survival, and glucolipotoxicity can activate mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), which, in turn, stimulates PDX1 degradation and causes dysfunction and apoptosis of beta-cells. Interestingly, previous research has demonstrated that increased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signalling effectively protects beta cells from glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Unfortunately, few studies have examined the related mechanism in detail, especially the role in Mst1 and PDX1 regulation. In the present study, we investigate the toxic effect of high glucose and FFA levels on rat pancreatic RINm5F beta-cells and demonstrate that the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide restores the expression of PDX1 by inactivating Mst1, thus ameliorating beta-cell impairments. In addition, liraglutide also upregulates mitophagy, which may help restore mitochondrial function and protect beta-cells from oxidative stress damage. Our study suggests that liraglutide may serve as a potential agent for developing new therapies to reduce glucolipotoxicity.

AB The effects of heating temperature, cooling method, re-curing time and water-to-cement ratio (w/c) on the natural restoration of mechanical properties of concrete exposed to high temperature were experimentally studied. The fire-damaged concrete specimens were re-cured in ambient conditions after they had been rapidly cooled in water and naturally cooled in air. Below 500 degrees C, the natural restoration of the compressive strength of water-cooled concrete was more evident than that of air-cooled concrete. The natural restoration of the compressive strength of air-cooled concrete with low w/c ratio was more obvious than that of concrete with high w/c ratio. After being subjected to 500 degrees C and re-cured for 3 months, the splitting tensile strength decreased to below 26% of the initial value. The splitting tensile strength of water-cooled concrete recovered more evidently than that of the air-cooled concrete. The restoration of elastic modulus was mainly affected by the heating temperature and cooling method. The elastic modulus of water-cooled concrete which had been subjected to 200, 300 and 400 degrees C was obviously restored after being naturally re-cured for 3 months. The effects of w/c on the tensile strength and elastic modulus were not significant.

AB Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of complete restoration of respiratory muscle function in subjects with spinal cord injury. Methods This was an interventional study investigating three subjects maintained on a diaphragm pacing system who were implanted with the spinal cord stimulation system to restore cough. Peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation were the primary physiologic outcome measures; an assessment of the degree of difficulty in raising secretions was the primary clinical outcome measure. Results Mean peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation during spontaneous efforts were 1.7 +/- 0.2 L/s and 31 +/- 7 cmH(2)O, respectively. When spinal cord stimulation was applied after pacing volume associated with the subject's maximum inspiratory effort and synchronized with the subject's maximum expiratory effort, peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation were 9.0 +/- 1.9 L/s and 90 +/- 6 cmH(2)O, respectively (P < 0.05). Moreover, each subject experienced much greater ease in raising secretions and marked improvement in the ease in raising secretions compared with other methods. Conclusions Complete restoration of respiratory muscle function can be safely and effectively achieved in the same individuals with spinal cord injury. Spinal cord stimulation results in peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation characteristic of a normal cough, whereas diaphragm pacing was successful in maintaining patients off mechanical ventilation.

AB For tropical forest restoration to result in long-term biodiversity gains, native trees must establish self-sustaining populations in degraded sites. While many have asked how seedling recruitment varies between restoration treatments, the long-term fate of these recruits remains unknown. We address this research gap by tracking natural recruits of 27 species during the first 7 years of a tropical forest restoration experiment that included both planted and naturally regenerating plots. We used an individual-based model to estimate the probability that a seedling achieves reproductive maturity after several years of growth and survival. We found an advantage for recruits in naturally regenerating plots, with up to 40% increased probability of reproduction in this treatment, relative to planted plots. The demographic advantage of natural regeneration was highest for mid-successional species, with relatively minor differences between treatments for early-successional species. Our research demonstrates the consequences of restoration decision making across the life cycle of tropical tree species.

AB Background After root canal treatment, a choice is made between different coronal restorations which in the long run could affect the survival of the tooth. Objective To compare demographic characteristics between individuals choosing an indirect coronal restoration (crown, inlay/onlay) and individuals choosing other restorations after completion of a root filling. Methods The cohort consisted of all root-filled upper first molars that were reported to the tax-funded Swedish Social Insurance Agency (SSIA) during 2009. After registration of the root filling, any subsequent coronal restorations within 2 years were identified. The crown group consisted of individuals registered with an indirect coronal restoration and the restoration group was the remaining individuals with a direct coronal restoration or lacking registration. Demographic data (gender, disposable income, age, educational level, civil status and country of birth) were received from Statistics Sweden or the SSIA. Statistical analyses included chi-square test, t test and logistic regression analysis. P Results An indirect coronal restoration was received by 7806 individuals (21.9%), and 27 886 individuals (78.1%) received a direct restoration. All demographic variables except gender differed significantly between groups. Logistic regression analysis found significant associations for all demographic variables and the registration of an indirect restoration except for country of birth and gender. Conclusions The identified demographic differences between individuals choosing to restore their newly root-filled teeth with an indirect restoration compared to those receiving other restorations may indicate that the tax-funded Swedish dental insurance fails to provide dental care on equal terms for Swedish citizens.

AB Although it is well-established how nutrients, growth factors, and hormones impact functional -cell mass (BCM), the influence of the central nervous system in this regard, and especially in the context of islet immune modulation, has been understudied. Here we investigated the expression and activity of pancreatic islet 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) in islet anti-inflammatory and prosurvival signaling. Systemic administration of 7nAChR agonists in mice improved glucose tolerance and curtailed streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia by retaining BCM, in part through maintaining Pdx1 and MafA expression and reducing apoptosis. 7nAChR activation of mouse islets ex vivo led to reduced inflammatory drive through a JAK2-STAT3 pathway that couples with CREB/Irs2/Akt survival signaling. Because the vagus nerve conveys anti-inflammatory signals to immune cells of the spleen and other nonneural tissues in the viscera by activating 7nAChR agonists, our study suggests a novel role for -cell 7nAChR that functions to maintain -cell survival and mass homeostasis through modulating islet cytokine and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways. Exploiting these pathways may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of autoimmune diabetes.

AB To reverse the effects of deforestation, tropical areas have expanded restoration efforts in recent years. As ecological restoration positively affects the structure and function of degraded ecosystems, understanding to what extent restoration recovers ecosystem services (ES) is an important step in directing large-scale restoration actions. We evaluated the effect of restoration in increasing the provision of ES in tropical forests. We performed a global meta-analysis of ecological indicators of the ES provided in restored areas, degraded areas and reference ecosystems. We tested for the effects of different restoration strategies, different types of degradation and for the effects of restoration over time. Overall, restoration actions contributed to a significant increase in levels of ecological indicators of ES (carbon pool, soil attributes and biodiversity protection) compared to disturbed areas. Among the restoration strategies, the natural regeneration was the most effective. Biodiversity protection and carbon recovered better than soil attributes. All other restoration strategies recovered ES to a substantially lesser degree, and reforestation with exotics decreased the ES of areas degraded by agriculture. In areas degraded by pasture, restoration was more effective in recovering the biodiversity protection, whereas in areas degraded by agriculture, the restoration recovered mainly the carbon pool. Our results show that by choosing the correct strategy, restoration can recover much of the ES lost by the degradation of tropical forests. These results should be considered for large-scale conservation and management efforts for this biome.

AB .The breaking of rotational symmetry on the lattice for bound eigenstates of the two lightest alpha conjugate nuclei is explored. Moreover, a macroscopic alpha-cluster model is used for investigating the general problems associated with the representation of a physical many-body problem on a cubic lattice. In view of the descent from the 3D rotation group to the cubic group symmetry, the role of the squared total angular momentum operator in the classification of the lattice eigenstates in terms of SO(3) irreps is discussed. In particular, the behaviour of the average values of the latter operator, the Hamiltonian and the inter-particle distance as a function of lattice spacing and size is studied by considering the 0+, 2+, 4+ and 6+ (artificial) bound states of Be-8 and the lowest 0+, 2+ and 3- multiplets of C-12.

   APOMYOGLOBIN; FIBRILS; STABILIZATION; ASSOCIATION; SCATTERING
AB Organisms having tolerances against extreme environments produce and accumulate stress proteins and/or sugars in cells against the extreme environment such as high or low temperature, drying, and so forth. Sugars and/or polyols are known to prevent protein denaturation and enzyme deactivation. In particular, trehalose has received considerable attention because of its association with cryptobiosis and anhydrobiosis. This study focuses on the restoration of acid-denatured amyloid transition of myoglobin by trehalose. Myoglobin is known to proceed amyloidogenic reaction under denaturation conditions. We found that acid-denatured myoglobin at an initial process of amyloidogenic reaction (helix-to-sheet transition followed by oligomerization) at 25 degrees C was substantially restored to its native structure by trehalose. This action was prominent during the early stage of amyloid formation. Recent results showed that sugars are preferentially excluded from the protein surface to preserve its hydration shell and stabilize the protein structure against chemical and thermal denaturation. Therefore, the present results suggest that trehalose will restore the tightly bound water molecules around the hotspot (G-helix) of myoglobin on the amyloid transition by its intrinsic preservative action of the native hydration shell against denaturation. The present finding on the restorative action by trehalose could provide new insights into protein folding and amyloidosis.

AB Constructions of large reservoirs (all over the world) have resulted in the degradation of riparian vegetation. The coverage and species biodiversity of riparian communities in the Three Gorges Reservoir area have dramatically decreased since the completion of the Three Gorges Project. The responses of three shrub seeds to flooding time were examined to investigate the potential use of soil seed banks for the ecological restoration of the drawdown zone in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The effects of flooding time on seed viability and seed nutrient composition for the riparian shrubs Buxus ichangensis, Cornus paucinervis and Distylium chinense were tested by simulating 0, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 month flooding periods under a controlled experiment. Results showed that seed viability decreased with the length of flooding treatment. Seeds of all three shrubs displayed relatively high viability and remained viable after six months of flooding. However, seed viability significantly decreased after seven months of flooding. After nine months of flooding, the seed viability of B. ichangensis, C. paucinervis and D. chinense decreased by 86.14%, 24.03% and 43.43%, respectively, compared with a non-flooded control. The protein, starch and soluble sugar content of seeds from the three shrubs decreased with flooding time. The seed bank samples of D. chinense and B. ichangensis showed the highest tolerance against short-term flooding, while the seeds of C. paucinervis exhibited the strongest tolerance against long-term flooding.

SO PLOS ONE
ID BIVALVIA; MANAGEMENT
AB Small-scale fisheries are large contributors to regional economies and livelihoods in coastal communities of Latin America. While Mexico is one of the cases where small-scale fisheries play an important role, overfishing and poor management strategies have led to the collapse of many of its fisheries. The cello de hacha scallop fishery of the Ensenada de La Paz in Baja California Sur is an example of such a fishery which, after years of mismanagement, was closed by the Mexican authorities in 2009. The present study evaluated the recovery efforts in the cove and the potential outcomes of a collaboration between a non-governmental organization and a fishing community working towards the restoration of this pen-shell fishery. After more than four years of closure and active monitoring of the recovering process, the cello de hacha population has shown a significant population recovery, with potential solvency for reopening fishing activities. Four scenarios of uncertainty are evaluated with two of them providing positive net present values from reopening the fishery. We also document the involvement of a non-governmental organization with a fishing community, which created social capital and, in our opinion, was essential for a successful restoration. Having an actively involved community helped raise funds for the fishing closure so fishers were able to comply with Mexican legislation; it also fostered community building and self-organization that will be crucial to maintaining the sustainability of the fishery.

TI Impacts of Yongding River Ecological Restoration on the Groundwater
   Environment: Scenario Prediction
SO VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
ID NORTH CHINA PLAIN; WATER; TRANSPORT; NITROGEN; TRANSFORMATIONS;
   RESOURCES; CHLORIDE
AB Reclaimed water was discharged into the Yongding River channels as ecological water. Pollutants from such water may leak into the underlying aquifer and put the groundwater environment at risk. River leakage estimation under different possible river lining conditions and the established groundwater flow and reactive solute transport model were jointly applied to investigate the impact of the ecological restoration of the Yongding River on the local groundwater environment. Scenario-based investigations were conducted since the channel reconstruction in 2009. The results show that the seepage from the Yongding River without liners can greatly raise the groundwater level. Leakage through liners constructed with geomembranes can effectively control the seepage of water and the spread of solutes in the aquifer. From June 2009 to December 2010, the leakage amount has been only 1.65 x 10(4) m(3), and the unconfined aquifer shows a negative budget of 4.55 x 10(7) m(3). The spreading extent of flow and potential pollutants increases with the amount of leakage from the river. Water management strategies, such as the South-to-North Water Diversion Project and Yongding River restoration could help alleviate the water deficit of the Yongding River alluvium fan (YRAF) by reducing groundwater exploitation and increasing groundwater recharge. The necessity of the maintenance of riverbed liners and control of the water quality of Yongding River were highlighted by the scenario analysis. The methods applied in this study could be used for reference in the other polluted rivers, especially with liner installation.

TI Change in fish functional diversity and assembly rules in the course of
   tidal marsh restoration

   RESPONSES; SUCCESSION INSIGHTS; CONTRASTING CHANGES; PATTERNS; ESTUARY;
   TRAIT; MECHANISMS
AB Functional trait theory provides a mechanistic framework to understand change in community composition and community assembly through time and space. Despite this, trait-based approaches have seldom been used in ecological restoration. Succession theory predicts that habitat complexity and resource availability will increase with restoration time, leading to increased functional dissimilarity among coexisting species. However, in the case of tidal marsh restoration, it is not clear whether reestablishing the harsh abiotic conditions typical of estuaries will initiate successional trajectories. We investigated monotonic changes in the functional structure of fish communities and shifts in assembly mechanisms, with tidal restoration time. A five-level gradient of 'intertidal habitat naturalness' was constructed from a set of artificialized (dyked), restored (with different ages) and natural intertidal sites, and used as a surrogate for restoration progress. The fish ecophases were described using ten functional traits related to food acquisition and swimming ability. The trends in six functional dimensions (identity, richness, evenness, dispersion, originality and specialization) were investigated along the naturalness gradient. Consistenly with succession theory, functional specialization, dispersion and, less markedly, richness increased with intertidal naturalness meaning that restored and natural intertidal habitats supplied fish with specific foraging and dwelling conditions absent from dyked marshes. Community assembly patterns varied with respect to traits and differed at both ends of the naturalness gradient. Dyked marshes were more affected by trait convergence possibly due to limiting resources. Environmental filtering was detected all along the naturalness gradient although the traits affected varied depending on the naturalness level of habitats. Environmental filtering tended to decrease in restored and natural intertidal habitats. Increased naturalness restored the attractivity of benthic habitats as feeding or settling grounds, promoted shelter-seeking vs. free-swimming strategists and favoured ecophases with carnivorous diets, feeding on microinvertebrates and benthic low-mobility macroinvertebrates. Approaches based on functional trait diversity have the potential to question and refine the theoretical frame of ecological restoration and to assist managers in their efforts to restore tidal wetlands.

AB Insufficient food during early life could limit the population growth of endangered Pallid Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus in the lower Missouri River. Shallow-water habitat restoration is intended to provide nursery benefits, including food, for young sturgeon, but the effect of shallow-water habitat on their diet is unknown. Age-0 Pallid Sturgeon are rare, providing little opportunity for direct evaluation; however, studying the closely related and abundant Shovelnose Sturgeon S. platorynchus may provide valuable information to guide habitat restoration efforts. We compared diet, body condition (lipid content), and change in body weight (24-h bioenergetics simulation) for postdrift, age-0 sturgeon among five reaches ranging widely in shallow-water habitat availability. Lipid content of satiated and emaciated laboratory-reared individuals were compared with that of wild-caught fish. In general, shallow-water habitat availability appeared to have little effect on the variables examined. Regardless of reach, wild-caught fish primarily consumed chironomids, and empty stomachs were rare. Additionally, differences in prey weight, lipid content, or the modeled change in body weight did not usually correspond to differences in shallow-water habitat availability. Instead, we found annual differences, as prey weight consumed and the percentage of fish with modeled weight gain was often higher in 2015 than 2014, while the opposite was true for the percentage of fish with lipid content values that were comparable with the emaciated laboratory standard. Overall, our findings complement recent suggestions that shallow-water habitat restoration efforts, as previously implemented, may not benefit sturgeon populations. Our results coupled with previous research suggest that the lower Missouri River prey base can support a stable Shovelnose Sturgeon population; however, additional research is needed to determine whether this applies to Pallid Sturgeon.

To increase trainable performance, we present a moderate depth residual network for the restoration of motion blurring and noisy images. The proposed network has only 10 layers, and the sparse feedbacks are added in the middle and the last layers, which are called FbResNet. FbResNet has fast convergence speed and effective denoising performance. In addition, it can also reduce the artificial Mosaic trace at the seam of patches, and visually pleasant output results can be produced from the blurred images or noisy images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our designed model and method.

AB In the effort to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food, health, water, and climate, an increase in pressure on land is highly likely. To avoid further land degradation and promote land restoration, multifunctional use of land is needed within the boundaries of the soil-water system. In addition, awareness-raising, a change in stakeholders' attitudes, and a change in economics are essential. The attainment of a balance between the economy, society, and the biosphere calls for a holistic approach. In this paper, we introduce four concepts that we consider to be conducive to realizing LDN in a more integrated way: systems thinking, connectivity, nature-based solutions, and regenerative economics. We illustrate the application of these concepts through three examples in agricultural settings. Systems thinking lies at the base of the three others, stressing feedback loops but also delayed responses. Their simultaneous use will result in more robust solutions, which are sustainable from an environmental, societal, and economic point of view. Solutions also need to take into account the level of scale (global, national, regional, local), stakeholders' interests and culture, and the availability and boundaries of financial and natural capital. Furthermore, sustainable solutions need to embed short-term management in long-term landscape planning. In conclusion, paradigm shifts are needed. First, it is necessary to move from excessive exploitation in combination with environmental protection, to sustainable use and management of the soil-water system. To accomplish this, new business models in robust economic systems are needed based on environmental systems thinking; an approach that integrates environmental, social, and economic interests. Second, it is necessary to shift from a "system follows function" approach towards a "function follows system" one. Only by making the transition towards integrated solutions based on a socio-economical-ecological systems analysis, using concepts such as nature-based solutions, do we stand a chance to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality by 2030. To make these paradigm shifts, awareness-raising in relation to a different type of governance, economy and landscape and land-use planning and management is needed.

AB There are growing efforts around the world to restore biocultural systems that produce food while also providing additional cultural and ecological benefits. Yet, there are few examples of integrated assessments of these efforts, impeding understanding of how they can contribute to multi-level sustainability goals. In this study, we collaborated with a community-based non-profit in Heeia, Oahu to evaluate future scenarios of traditional wetland and flooded field system agriculture (loi kalo; taro fields) restoration in terms of locally-relevant cultural, ecological, and economic outcomes as well as broader State of Hawaii sustainability goals around food, energy, and water. Families participating in the biocultural restoration program described a suite of community and cultural benefits stemming from the process of restoration, including enhanced social connections, cultural (re)connections to place, and physical and mental well-being, which inspired their sustained participation. We also found benefits in terms of local food production that have the potential to provide economic returns and energy savings over time, particularly when carried out through a hybrid non-profit and family management model. These benefits were coupled with potential changes in sediment and nutrient retention with implications for water quality and the health of an important downstream fish pond (loko ia) and coral reef social-ecological system. Compared with the current land cover (primarily invasive grasses), results suggest that full restoration of loi kalo would decrease sediment export by 38%, but triple nitrogen export due to organic fertilizer additions. However, compared with an urban scenario, there were clear benefits of agricultural restoration in terms of reduced nitrogen and sediment runoff. In combination, our results demonstrate that a biocultural approach can support the social and financial sustainability of agricultural systems that provide multiple benefits valued by the local community and non-profit while also contributing to statewide sustainability goals.

AB The energy demand in Indonesia has increased significantly with its population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The growing concern of meeting energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuels has resulted in an increasing demand for renewable energy. As a country with a rich biomass base, bioenergy is now an important component of Indonesia's energy agenda. However, a crucial problem in bioenergy production is the selection of species that can provide a sustainable supply of feedstock without having an impact on food security and the environment. In this context, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of using bamboo, a perennial grass, as a potential species for bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia. We describe the fuel characteristics of bamboo along with the possibility to align its cultivation, production, and usage with environmental and developmental agendas which makes it a suitable bioenergy crop in the country. In addition, its ability to grow on degraded lands, fast growth, long root system, and easy maintenance prove it as a powerful ally for the restoration of degraded land. We recommend in-depth research on the social, ecological, and economic feasibility of using this species for bioenergy production.

AB Restoration strategies for coral reefs are usually focused on the recovery of bio-physical characteristics. They seldom include an evaluation of the recovery of the socio-ecological and ecosystem services features of coral reef systems. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to address both the socio-ecological system features of coral reefs with the implementation of restoration activity for degraded coral reefs. Such a framework can lead to better societal outcomes from restoration activities while restoring bio-physical, social and ecosystem service features of such systems. We first developed a Socio Ecological System Analysis Framework, which combines the Ostrom Framework for analyzing socio-ecological systems and the Kittinger et al. human dimensions framework of coral reefs socio-ecological systems. We then constructed a Restoration of Coral Reef Framework, based on the most used and recent available coral reef restoration literature. These two frameworks were combined to present a Socio-Ecological Systems & Restoration Coral Reef Framework. These three frameworks can be used as a guide for managers, researchers and decision makers to analyze the needs of coral reef restoration in a way that addresses both socio-economic and ecological objectives to analyze, design, implement and monitor reef restoration programs.

AB An analysis of land use/cover change (LUCC) on the Loess Plateau over the past 30 years and its environmental effects was performed to provide scientific guidance for a sustainable development policy for the regional ecological environment and social economy. Geostatistical and trend analyses are used to study the LUCC characteristics, driving forces and environmental effects, and the relationship between LUCC and regional sustainable development is explored. The following results were obtained: (1) Overall, the land use structure has not changed, with grassland, farmland, and forest land remaining dominant; however, the vegetation coverage has significantly increased, especially in the central area. (2) LUCC is affected by climate change and human activities, with greater climate change impacts in the northwest than the southeast and greater among which human-induced impacts on the hilly/gully region in the central part. (3) LUCC will produce long-term ecological and environmental processes, such as surface runoff, soil erosion, soil moisture and carbon cycling. Vegetation restoration has both negative and positive effects on the regional ecological environment. Vegetation productivity on the Loess Plateau has approached the water resource carrying capacity threshold. Therefore, improving artificial vegetation stability and promoting the water resources balance have become the main strategies for promoting sustainable development on the Loess Plateau.

AB Habitat loss is a key factor affecting Siberian crane stopovers. The accurate calculation of water supply and effective water resource management schemes plays an important role in stopover habitat restoration for the Siberian crane. In this paper, the ecological water demand was calculated and corrected by developing a three-dimensional model. The results indicated that the calculated minimum and optimum ecological water demand values for the Siberian crane were 2.47 x 10(8) m(3)similar to 3.66 x 10(8) m(3) and 4.96 x 10(8) m(3)similar to 10.36 x 10(8) m(3), respectively, in the study area. After correction with the three-dimensional model, the minimum and optimum ecological water demand values were 3.75 x 10(8) m(3) and 5.21 x 10(8) m(3), respectively. A water resource management scheme was established to restore Siberian crane habitat. Continuous, area-specific and simulated flood water supply options based on water diversions were used to supply water. The autumn is the best season for area-specific and simulating flood water supply. These results can serve as a reference for protecting other waterbirds and restoring wetlands in semi-arid areas.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of composite resin type and light curing source on the microleakage of composite restorations.
   The material consisted of 48 Class V cavities prepared on 24 extracted human premolars. The cavities were divided into two groups (n = 24), depending on the applied composite resin (flowable Filtek Ultimate vs universal Valux Plus). The division into two subgroups (n = 12) was dependent on the used light curing source (halogen ESPE Elipar Highlight vs LED Twinlex Blue Lex). The evaluation of composite restorations microleakage was performed using the dye penetration method with 1% methylene blue solution. The dye penetration was assessed after the longitudinal cut of the teeth. It was ranked according to the scale of 0-4.
   The highest microleakage score was in the group with flowable composite and halogen light (2.92 +/- 1.16), and the lowest in the group with universal composite and LED light (0.75 +/- 1.36). Mann-Whitney test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the composite restorations microleakage between the following groups: flowable/halogen vs universal/halogen, flowable/LED vs universal/LED and flowable/halogen vs universal/LED (p < 0.05).
   It can be concluded that the influence of composite resin type on composite restorations microleakage is higher than of the light curing source.

AB To evaluate the occlusion accuracy of a novel impression technique, excessively high occlusion and the occlusal contact area during lateral movements were compared between metal restorations (restorations) and removable partial dentures (RPDs) fabricated using conventional and novel techniques. Both restorations and RPDs were fabricated on the simulation model with the precise displacement of the remaining teeth and soft tissue. For the novel technique, functionally generated path (FGP) recording and impression under occlusal force were simultaneously performed using a custom tray with an FGP table. For the two conventional techniques, definitive casts were mounted on an average value articulator and a semi-adjustable articulator in the typical manner. Prostheses were placed on the simulation models, and excessively high occlusion in the intercuspal position and occlusal contact areas during lateral movements were measured. Statistical analyses were performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Steel-Dwass tests (alpha = 0.05). For both prostheses, conventional techniques showed significantly higher occlusion in the intercuspal position than the novel technique. Moreover, the new technique demonstrated better guidance contact during lateral movements than conventional techniques. This novel technique can be recommended for the fabrication of highly accurate prostheses with appropriate occlusal contact without corrections at delivery.

DE Underground cavity; Expansive material; Stress release zone; Numerical
   analysis
AB Recently, the number of ground subsidence resulting from underground cavity has been increased. Accordingly, the importance of restoration of stress release zone around the underground cavity has been emphasized. The stress release zone is composed of low density soils having extremely low stiffness and degree of compaction, which can lead to additional cavity expansion and collapse of overlying ground. Therefore, in this study, the suitability of restoration method of underground cavity using expansive material for reinforcement of stress release zone around the cavity is verified. The basic physical properties and expansion characteristics of the expansive material were examined. The experiment equipment capable simulating of stress release zone was developed and is used to investigate the effect of expanding material on stress release zone. The stress release zone was simulated using the spring in numerical analysis. The factors of the volume ratio of the underground cavity to the expansion material, the degree of stress relaxation, and the shape of the cavity were varied in numerical simulations, and the behavior of stress release zone was analyzed based on the numerical analysis results. Analysis variables are factors that affect each other. Also, filling of underground cavity and capacity of restoration of stress release zone were confirmed when the expansive material was inserted into underground cavity.

AB This paper described a results of field test based on plate bearing test of the restoration material, which was developed to restore the ground cavity due to sewerage damage. The analysis of bearing capacity characteristics on the restoration materials was performed by experimental results. The results showed that the load bearing capacity in the maximum stress condition of the foundation ground is about 66%-70%, when the expansion mat is embedded at the bottom of 0.1 m and 0.2 m from the ground surface. However, The load bearing capacity of expansion mat according to embedded depth was not large. The load bearing capacity of concrete mats was about 82%-90% compared with that of ground surface, and it showed about 50% of the load bearing capacity compared with the expansion mat. As a result of analysis of allowable bearing capacity according to restoration materials, it was confirmed that the allowable bearing capacity of the expansion mat and the concrete was about 130%-150% and about 160% more than the foundation ground, respectively.

AB Numerous restoration projects are underway in Puget Sound, Washington, USA with the goal of re-establishing intertidal wetlands that were historically lost due to dike construction for flood protection and agricultural development. One such effort is the restoration effort within the Stillaguamish Delta, benefitting from the cumulative effects from the Leque Island and zis a ba restoration projects. The preferred restoration design calls for the removal of perimeter dikes at the two sites and the creation of tidal channels to facilitate the drainage of tidal flows. A 3-D high-resolution unstructured-grid coastal ocean model based on FVCOM was developed to evaluate the hydrodynamic response of the estuary to restoration alternatives. A series of hydrodynamic modeling simulations were then performed to quantify the hydrodynamic response of the nearshore restoration project, such as periodic inundation, suitable currents, and desired habitat/ salinity levels. Sediment impacts were also examined, including the potential for excessive erosion or sedimentation requiring maintenance. Simulation results indicate that the preferred alternative scenario provides the desired estuarine response, which is consistent with the planned design. A decrease in velocities and bed shear in the main river channels was noted for the restored condition associated with the increased inundation of tidal flat area and reduced tidal flows through the main channels. High bed shear near the restored tidal channel entrances indicates that the inlets may evolve in size until equilibrium is established.

AB Ecological restoration efforts can increase the diversity and function of degraded areas. However, current restoration practices cannot typically reestablish the full diversity and species composition of remnant plant communities. We present evidence that restoration quality can be improved by reintroducing key organisms from the native plant microbiome. In particular, root symbionts called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are crucial in shaping grassland communities, but are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, which may pose a problem for grassland restoration. In the present article, we highlight the conceptual motivation and empirical evidence evaluating native mycorrhizal fungi, as opposed to commercial fungi. Reintroduction of the native microbiome and native mycorrhizal fungi improves plant diversity, accelerates succession, and increases the establishment of plants that are often missing from restored communities. The example of mycorrhizal fungi serves to illustrate the value of a more holistic view of plant communities and restoration that embraces the intricacies and dynamics of native microbial communities.

AB Researchers on conservation planning and practice have increasingly recognized and adopted the pivotal role of landscape attributes in shaping the effectiveness of protected areas. However, the degree to which these concepts have been integrated into habitat restoration projects has not been quantified. We reviewed the global literature and found that landscape context was considered in fewer than one in eight restoration projects in the selection of restoration sites (11% of 472 projects). This figure was remarkably similar across terrestrial (10% of 243 projects), marine (13% of 89), and freshwater (13% of 164) ecosystems. Of the 54 restoration projects in which landscape context was considered in site selection, in just over half (56%), animal populations were reported to be larger or more diverse than in control areas. Tighter integration of concepts from spatial ecology and systematic conservation planning into restoration practice could improve the design, optimize placement, and enhance the ecological effectiveness of restoration projects in all ecosystems.

A giomer (Beautifil II, Shofu Dental), a compomer (Dyract eXtra, Dentsply Sirona) and a hybrid composite resin (Gaenial Posterior, GC Corporation) were selected for this study. Twenty disk-shaped specimens of each material were heated at room temperature (21 degrees C), at 37 degrees C, at 50 degrees C and at 60 degrees C. Vickers microhardness test was performed on top and bottom surfaces using digital microhardness tester (Micro-Vickers Hardness System CV-400DMTM, CV Instruments Namicon). The top and bottom surfaces VHN was calculated as a mean value of five determinations. Also, the microhardness ratio was calculated by dividing the top mean VHN value by bottom mean VHN value. Increased mean hardness values were recorded after heating, irrespective of resin-based tested materials. The highest hardness values were recorded after heating all three materials at 60 degrees C, followed by the hardness recorded at 50 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 21 degrees C. For top surfaces, the lowest hardness value was recorded in Dyract eXtra group when samples were warmed at room temperature and the highest hardness value was obtained in Beautifil II group when samples where heated at 60 degrees C. For the bottom surfaces, Dyract eXtra specimens heated at 21 degrees C presented the lowest hardness values and Beautifil II samples heated at 60 degrees C presented the highest hardness values. On top and on bottom surfaces Dyract eXtra showed the lowest hardness values, followed by G-aenial Posterior and Beautifil II, irrespective the heating temperature.

AB Flash-Free Orthodontic Adhesive System represents the latest technology in the field of orthodontics. In the present study the bonding technique is applied on CAD/CAM produced resin crowns. Ten resin blocks were shaped after an upper premolar crown design from the 3Shape Library, and they were divided ino two groups: on Group 1, control, Clarity Advanced braces (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA) were bonded using XT Adhesive Paste (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA), while on Groups 2 same aesthetic brackets were applied, using the APC Flash-Free Adhesive Coated Appliance System (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA). Bracket positioning time was recorded for each sample. Zwick Zoel Z005 testing machine was used to measure the shear bond strength (SBS) at which debonding takes place. Adhesive remnant index (ARI was registered, as well as presence or absence of adhesive flash and accuracy of flash cleaning before curing. Group 1 showed a mean bonding time of 46.4 s, while Group 2 needed about 20.6 s for each bracket bonding. Mean SBS values for both groups are considered clinically acceptable (6.27 MPa for Group 1 and 7.77 MPa for Group 2). ARI scores were zero for all samples and after debonding on group 1 can be observed the adhesive flash. In conclusion, APC Flash-Free Coated Appliance System showed reduced time for bracket positioning compared to the conventional technique. APC Flash-Free System showed acceptable SBS values, higher than the uncoated brackets. No composite was left on the resin crown after debonding, the adhesive flash resulted in the conventional technique remaining on the edges of the debonded brackets.

AB Using nanotechnology to produce composite materials it has been possible to obtain materials with similar or better mechanical properties than previous generation of microhybrids, and with exceptional aesthetics and chandelier due to the particularities of nanomaterials. At the same time, the improvement of adhesive techniques to enamel and dentin allowed the expansion of the area of direct composite restorations with a better prognostic over time. Eight cane-free molars were used and each of them was prepared with two class II cavities, which were filled using the C13 and C20 nanocomposites and the A1 and A2 experimental adhesive systems prepared at the Raluca Ripan Chemistry Research Institute. The teeth were divided into four groups of two teeth each, depending on the adhesive system and the composite material used. Scanning electron microscopy images (SEM) have described the adhesive interface and structure characteristics for the two nanocomposite materials and for the two studied adhesive systems. The studied nanocomposites have a variable number of porosities and air bubbles, with a clinical importance which is yet hard to establish. The experimental adhesives used produce a good interface and infiltration of the smear-layer but have not been visualized inside the dentinal canals. In vitro studies are necessary to evaluate the durability of adhesion in the case of self-etch adhesives in one or two steps.

   MANAGEMENT; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS
AB Common practices for invasive species control and management include physical, chemical, and biological approaches. The first two approaches have clear limitations and may lead to unintended (negative) consequences, unless carefully planned and implemented. For example, physical removal rarely completely eradicates the targeted invasive species and can cause disturbances that facilitate new invasions by nonnative species from nearby habitats. Chemical treatments can harm native, and especially rare, species through unanticipated side effects. Biological methods may be classified as biocontrol and the ecological approach. Similar to physical and chemical methods, biocontrol also has limitations and sometimes leads to unintended consequences. Therefore, a relatively safer and more practical choice may be the ecological approach, which has two major components: (1) restoration of native species and (2) biomass manipulation of the restored community, such as selective grazing or prescribed burning (to achieve and maintain viable population sizes). Restoration requires well-planned and implemented planting designs that consider alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity and the abundance of native and invasive component species at local, landscape, and regional levels. Given the extensive destruction or degradation of natural habitats around the world, restoration could be most effective for enhancing ecosystem resilience and resistance to biotic invasions. At the same time, ecosystems in human-dominated landscapes, especially those newly restored, require close monitoring and careful intervention (e.g., through biomass manipulation), especially when successional trajectories are not moving as intended. Biomass management frequently uses prescribed burning, grazing, harvesting, and thinning to maintain overall ecosystem health and sustainability. Thus, the resulting optimal, balanced, and relatively stable ecological conditions could more effectively limit the spread and establishment of invasive species. Here we review the literature (especially within the last decade) on ecological approaches that involve biodiversity, biomass, and productivity, three key community/ecosystem variables that reciprocally influence one another. We focus on the common and most feasible ecological practices that can aid in resisting new invasions and/or suppressing the dominance of existing invasive species. We contend that, because of the strong influences from neighboring areas (i.e., as exotic species pools), local restoration and management efforts in the future need to consider the regional context and projected climate changes.

SO INDO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
DE periodontal destruction; amalgam overhang; dental amalgam
AB Periodontal structures are vital tissues that can be affected by the environment. Dental materials and / or restorations may trigger a negative reaction such as gingivitis and bone loss of periodontal tissues.
   Objective: The aim of this analysis is to determine the overhang interproximal amalgam prevalence and its restoration by undergraduate students.
   Study design: A stratified random sampling technique.
   Location and Duration: In the Nishtar Institute of Dentistry, Multan for six months duration from January 2018 to June 2018.
   Methods: For analysis 32 patients (male) between 18-43 years were selected randomly. 966 proximal surfaces and Posterior bitewing radiographs were taken and were evaluated. For data analysis SPSS version 17.0 was used. To evaluate the association between the surface of the overhang and location, Chi-square test was used.
   Results: It was determined that 34% of the 206 surfaces restored with amalgam were hanged. Among the upper amalgam restorations, 26.91% in the lower posterior teeth and 73.0% were in the upper posterior teeth. In amalgam examinations, mesial were 57.1% and distal were 42.9%. There was no vast variation in the amalgam restorations prevalence between premolar (46.91%) and molars (53.09%) (P> 0.05).
   Conclusion: This study clearly defined the high prevalence of significant interproximal margins in amalgam restorations.

AB Global energy demand has driven expansion of oil and gas extraction into African protected areas, raising concern about potential deleterious impacts on wildlife. Efforts aim to restore extraction sites to their original condition, but may take many years to be successful. We analysed the impact of human disturbance (road density, distance to border, sound levels and the presence of restored oil drill pads) on mammal distributions in Murchison Falls Conservation Area (MFCA), Uganda. We detected 27 mammal species using camera trap surveys within three disturbance-related strata: restored (<500 m from a restored drill pad), disturbed matrix (within the disturbed landscape but >1 km from a disturbance feature) and remote (>3 km from any disturbance). Herbivore species richness was greater within the disturbed matrix and at restored sites compared to remote areas, whereas species richness did not vary by strata for other guilds. Occupancy models fit for 15 relatively common species indicated no difference in occupancy probability across the three strata, but giraffe occupancy was higher at sites with more restored drill pads. Most species did not avoid areas of high human disturbance in this study, and new vegetation growth may attract some herbivores to restored oil sites.

AB Many drylands have been converted from perennial-dominated ecosystems to invaded, annual-dominated, fire-prone systems. Innovative approaches are needed to disrupt fire-invasion feedbacks. Targeted grazing can reduce invasive plant abundance and associated flammable fuels, and fuelbreaks can limit fire spread. Restored strips of native plants (native greenstrips) can function as fuelbreaks while also providing forage and habitat benefits. However, methods for establishing native greenstrips in invaded drylands are poorly developed. Moreover, if fuels reduction and greenstrip establishment are to proceed simultaneously, it is critical to understand how targeted grazing interacts with plant establishment. We determined how targeted grazing treatments interacted with seed rate, spatial planting arrangement (mixtures vs. monoculture strips), seed coating technology, and species identity (five native grasses) to affect standing biomass and seeded plant density in experimental greenstrips. We monitored for two growing seasons to document effects during the seedling establishment phase. Across planting treatments, ungrazed paddocks had the highest second-year seeded plant densities and the highest standing biomass. Paddocks grazed in fall of the second growing season had fewer seedlings than paddocks grazed in spring, five months later. High seed rates minimized negative effects of grazing on plant establishment. Among seeded species, Elymus trachycaulus and Poa secunda had the highest second-year densities, but achieved this via different pathways. Elymus trachycaulus produced the most first-year seedlings, but declined in response to grazing, whereas P. secunda had moderate first-year establishment but high survival across grazing treatments. We identified clear tradeoffs between reducing fuel loads and establishing native plants in invaded sagebrush steppe; similar tradeoffs may exist in other invaded drylands. In our system, tradeoffs were minimized by boosting seed rates, using grazing-tolerant species, and delaying grazing. In invaded ecosystems, combining targeted grazing with high-input restoration may create opportunities to limit wildfire risk while also shifting vegetation toward more desirable species.

AB In this study, an output-based neuro controller was built based on the idea of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and its capabilities in response simulation, data cleansing and restoration capability were verified using measurement data from actual structural testing. The ANFIS is a family of the deep learning algorithm, which incorporates the benefits of adaptive control technique, artificial neural network, and the fuzzy inference system. Thus, it is expected to produce very accurate predictions even for the highly nonlinear system. Forced vibration responses of a five-story steel building were simulated by ANFIS and its accuracy was compared with the results of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is a type of traditional artificial neural networks. Simulations by ANFIS were very accurate with a much lower root means square error (RMSE) than RNN. Simulated data by ANFIS showed an almost perfect match with the original. Even the small ripples in the power spectrum plot outside the dominant frequency were successfully reproduced. In addition, the ANFIS was used to increase the sampling rate of dynamic data. It was shown that missing high-frequency contents could be successfully reproduced when the ANFIS was properly trained. Lastly, The ANFIS was applied to remove the noise in the measured data from RC column cyclic load tests. The outliers were corrected effectively, but the tendency of flattening the peak values was observed.

AB The attempts to restore Lake Wolsztynskie, by direct dosing to the water iron sulphate (PIX 113) and chloride polyaluminium (PAX 18) in 2005-2006, and then iron chloride to the lake's bottom sediments in 2012-2013, resulted in only short-lasting improvement of water quality . In 2016, the physicochemical and biological parameters have shown that the lake should be classified into eutrophic and even hypertrophic, primarily because of the high concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyll a as well as low visibility. Although in theory, the methods of restoration were selected correctly, in practice, the improvement of water quality in a flow-through lake without eliminating the influx of water from allochthonous sources of pollution was impossible. The total load of nutrients arriving in Lake Wolsztynskie from the direct catchment, that is point and atmospheric sources, was 1877 kg P and 17 137 kg N , respectively. At the moment, the actual load of phosphorus in Lake Wolsztynskie is about 12-fold higher than the one deemed as tolerable by the ecosystem. About 86% of the phosphorus load is delivered from the main river (Dojca River), thus, elimination of this source of pollution is the necessary condition for attaining lasting improvement of the water quality in this lake. Analyzing the hydrological conditions, landscape relief as well as economic and environmental conditions, a possible solution of cutting the Dojca River waters from Lake Wolsztynskie was given.

AB Bielsko Lake is large (257.9 ha) and deep (max. depth 23m, mean depth 6.2 m) lake, located in the Pomerania Region, serving as a receiver of treated municipal sewage as well as stormwater, from the town of Bialy Bor. Deterioration of water quality has been observed in recent years - the lake was still a in moderate state (III class) in 1997, but now it is in a poor condition (IV class) with low Secchi depth (to 0.3m), high chlorophyll-a content (up to 153 mu g dm(-3)) and cyanobacterial water bloom in summer, dominated by Planktothrix agardhii, Aphanizomenon gracile, Planktolyngbya limnetica and Pseudanabaena limnetica. External nutrient load exceeds 3.4 times the permissible TN load and 2.4 times TP load, according to Vollenweider's criteria. To improve the ecological state of Bielsko Lake protective measures against pollution have been proposed. Treated municipal sewage should be diverted from the lake by the transport to specially prepared filtering fields, which will drain the sewage into the ground. Stormwater should be treated in a sedimentation and biofiltration system before being discharged to the lake. As internal loading from bottom sediments is very high, sustainable restoration was also proposed. Soluble reactive phosphorus in the water column could be inactivated using small and accurately calculated doses of iron sulfate and magnesium chloride. A cascading effect of trophic interactions of the food web on phytoplankton could be obtained using piscivorous fish stocking (biomanipulation method).

AB This paper introduces a synchronized routing problem for planning and scheduling restorative efforts for infrastructure networks in the aftermath of a disruptive event. In this problem, a set of restoration crews are dispatched from depots to a road network to restore the disrupted infrastructure network. Two mathematical formulations are presented to scheduling and sequencing disrupted network components to restoration crews and route the crews towards disrupted components to maximize network resilience progress in any given time horizon. In the first formulation, the number of restoration crews assigned to each disrupted component, the arrival time of each assigned crew to each disrupted component and consequently the restoration rate associated with each disrupted component are considered as variables to increase the flexibility of the model in the presence of different disruptive events. Along with the contributions applies in the first formulation, in the second formulation, each disrupted component can be partially active during its restoration process. To find the coordinated routes, we propose a relaxed mixed integer program as well as a set of valid inequalities which relates the planning and scheduling efforts to decision makers policies. The integration of the relaxed formulation and valid inequalities results in a lower bound for the original formulations. We further introduce a feasibility algorithm to derive a strong initial solution for the routing restorative capacity problem. Computational results on gas, water, and electric power infrastructure network instances from Shelby County, TN data, demonstrates both the effectiveness of the proposed model formulation, in solving small to medium scale problems, the strength of the initial solution procedure, especially for large scale problems.

AB The acquisition of positron emission tomography (PET) pulses introduces artifacts and limits the performance of the scanner. To minimize these inadequacies, this work focuses on the design of an offset compensated digital baseline restorer (BLR) along with a two-stage hybrid interpolator. They respectively treat the incoming pulse offsets and limited temporal resolution and improve the scanner performance in terms of calculating depth of interactions and line of responses. The offset of incoming PET pulses is compensated by the BLR and then their interesting parts are selected. The selected signal portion is up-sampled with a hybrid interpolator. It is composed of an optimized weighted least-squares interpolator (WLSI) and a simplified linear interpolator. The processes of calibrating the WLSI coefficients and characterizing the BLR and the interpolator modules are described. The functionality of the proposed modules is verified with an experimental setup. Results have shown that the devised BLR effectively compensates a dynamic range of bipolar offsets. The signal selection process allows focusing only on the relevant signal part and avoids the unnecessary operations during the post-interpolation process. Additionally, the hybrid nature allows improving the signal temporal resolution with an appropriate precession at a reduced computational complexity compared to the mono-interpolationbased arithmetically complex counterparts. The component-level architectures of the BLR and the interpolator modules are also described. It promises an efficient integration of these modules in modern PET scanners while using standard and economical analog-to-digital converters and field-programmable gate arrays. It avoids the development of high-performance and expensive application-specific integrated circuits and results in a cost-effective realization.

AB Forest restoration has potential to recover degraded ecosystem functions in disturbed environments. Decomposition and denitrification are two critical functions involved in forest nutrient cycling that are often compromised in degraded ecosystems. As forest canopy structure develops following initial plantings, it may indirectly impact ecosystem functions by altering abiotic conditions. It is likely, however, that there are other abiotic factors that affect decomposition and denitrification that are unrelated to forest canopy structure. Here, we aimed to determine whether forest canopy openness, topography, and soil sand content would affect litter decomposition and denitrification by regulating the microclimate, the herbaceous plant layer, soil chemistry, and soil moisture. Research occurred in restored native temperate rainforest patches in two New Zealand cities. Urban forests are an excellent context for measuring impact of canopy restoration on ecosystem properties such as microclimate due to the extreme swings in city conditions (e.g., urban heat island). Decomposition rates were determined using leaf litter bags and denitrification rates through denitrification enzyme activity assays. We used structural equation modeling to quantify the direct and indirect drivers of these ecosystem functions. Results indicated that decomposition rates were positively related to soil moisture, relative humidity, and herbaceous plant cover. Interestingly, forest canopy openness indirectly affected decomposition through counteracting forces, meaning greater canopy openness in young forests permitted dense herbaceous plant growth which enhanced decomposition, while less canopy openness in older forests enhanced humidity levels which increased decomposition. Denitrification was negatively related to soil pH and positively related to soil moisture, but these abiotic factors were unrelated to the forest canopy. Discovering drivers of ecosystem functions can improve approaches to the restoration of degraded ecosystems, especially in disturbed urban areas. Identifying counteracting effects on ecosystem functions could improve management by focusing restoration actions on specific drivers to elicit desired changes. Some ecosystem processes, like denitrification, are not affected by forest canopy restoration or management, but are instead driven by edaphic and landscape factors.

AB Bivalve molluscs provide water quality benefits throughout mid-Atlantic watersheds, such as Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River basins. Whereas most of the attention has focused on the role of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, there are many other bivalve species. in both salt and fresh waters, that provide similar benefits. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the capacity of diverse mid-Atlantic bivalves to filter particles and potentially enhance water clarity and quality. Species with the greatest clearance rates and population carrying capacity were also considered for their restoration and enhancement potential. Compared with eastern oysters, several additional species of saltwater bivalves and freshwater mussels are reported to filter water at rates that merit restoration attention and have been shown to attain significant population sizes. More work is needed to estimate system-carrying capacity and to eliminate restoration bottlenecks for some species-all bivalve species have constraints on their distribution and abundance. Nevertheless, a diversified, watershed-wide bivalve restoration strategy is likely to be more successful than a monospecific focus because it would address pollutant issues in more diverse places and multiple habitats along the river to estuary continuum.

The methodology presented in this study concerns the "Castello di Fossa" restoration project in central Italy, which was hit by an earthquake in 2009. Cooperation between the two teams working on the project led to the development of new ideas and the definition of an innovative role for the castle within the urban and rural landscape. The project looked at how to improve energetic and structural performance through the retrofitting of the building, whilst at the same time guaranteeing the conservation of its architectural values. Lastly, the results of this joint work undertaken by archaeologists, researchers from the National Research Centre (CNR ITC, L'Aquila) and the University of L'Aquila (DICEAA) and designers, are presented as well as the coherence of the reconstruction.

TI Defining Success Criteria for Spartina alterniflora Restoration Projects
   in Southwestern Louisiana
SO SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST
ID SALT MARSHES; MONITORING PROTOCOL; MITIGATION
AB Evaluation of success in salt-marsh restoration is often driven by subjective measures. By defining success criteria (SC), project effectiveness can be measured quantitatively. Herein, we quantify SC for an existing Spartina alterniflora (Smooth Cordgrass) restoration program. We selected stem density as an indicator of primary production and canopy structure-2 important salt-marsh functions. We established SC through use of stein densities from the literature and prior restoration projects and calculated a coefficient of variation (CV) for reference groups. By using the CV, we determined the strength of a particular reference group for SC formulation. We calculated success criteria for reference groups with CV <= 0.25. Three reference groups met the CV requirement. Only 1 project met the SC of the strongest reference group (CV = 0.04). Four of 5 projects met the SC of the weakest reference group (CV = 0.21). Reference sites with low variation in the target indicator should be selected for SC formulation.

AB Wetlands provide vital services for the livelihoods of local peoples; however, the ecological integrity of wetlands in Ethiopia has not yet been studied. In this study, we investigated the main ecosystem services of wetlands among different land use types, incorporating local perception toward wetland management. Six wetlands were selected from forested, agricultural and urban areas in the Jimma highlands. A total of 332 local residents within a 5-km radius of each wetland were surveyed. An additional 34 development agents and district and zonal experts were interviewed. The provisioning and cultural services were found to surpass the regulatory and supporting services of wetlands in agricultural and urban land uses compared with wetlands located in the forest. Although most individuals positively viewed wetland regulation and supporting services, the majority of households (66%) were not interested in conserving wetlands because of small landholdings and the need to meet their livelihoods. Consequently, the vital regulatory and supporting services of impacted agricultural and urban wetlands are gradually becoming limited. Urgent action is, therefore, required to restore and protect these wetlands by promoting alternative livelihoods and improving the agricultural productivity of small landholders.

AB Eutrophication has caused many serious environmental issues in lakes. Submerged vegetation, which plays a key role in maintaining the clear water state of shallow lakes, is strongly influenced by water quality and sediment properties. In this study, we seasonally investigated the water quality, sediment properties and submerged plant communities in 18 sites in Lake Honghu of China, an internationally important wetland under the Ramsar Convention. Results indicated that most of the water quality parameters and sediment properties showed no significant difference among the three site types (i.e., perennially vegetated, seasonally vegetated and unvegetated). However, the Secchi depth in perennially and seasonally vegetated sites was significantly higher that in unvegetated sites. By contrast, season had a strong effect on most of the water quality parameters and sediment properties (e.g., water chlorophyll-a concentration). For submerged vegetation, species richness and biomass showed significant spatial but not seasonal differences, with higher richness and biomass in perennially vegetated sites. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the distribution of submerged plants was mainly determined by water NH4+ concentration and water depth. Our findings suggest that restoration of submerged vegetation in Chinese eutrophic lakes may be a feasible method for improving water environments and enhancing ecological functions.

ID NETWORK; STRATEGY
AB Optimizing the power system restoration path is a key issue for the system restoration after a blackout. Because the optimization is a complex nonlinear programming problem, artificial intelligent algorithms are widely employed to solve this problem due to its modeling flexibility and strong optimization capability. However, because the dimension of restoration path optimization is very high especially for large-scale systems, artificial intelligent algorithms in current works are easy to be trapped in the local optima. To improve the optimal solution from the artificial intelligence algorithms, an orthogonal genetic algorithm is employed in this paper to optimize the restoration path, which can search the solution space in a statistically sound manner. First, the experimental design method was employed to generate orthogonal array as the initial population which was scattered uniformly over the feasible solution space. Then, the orthogonal crossover operator based on the orthogonal experimental design was employed to generate a small but representative feasible solution as the potential offspring. Finally, the proposed method is validated by using the IEEE 118-bus test system and part of the Jiangsu power grid in China.

AB Achromatopsia causes severely reduced visual acuity, photoaversion, and inability to discern colors due to cone photoreceptor dysfunction. In 2010, we reported on day-blindness in sheep caused by a stop-codon mutation of the ovine CNGA3 gene and began gene augmentation therapy trials in this naturally occurring large animal model of CNGA3 achromatopsia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety results of treatment, findings that hold great relevance for clinical trials that started recently in CNGA3 achromatopsia patients. Nine day-blind sheep were available for long-term follow up. The right eye of each sheep was treated with a single subretinal injection of an Adeno-Associated Virus Type 5 (AAV5) vector carrying either a mouse (n = 4) or a human (n = 5) CNGA3 transgene under control of the 2.1-Kb red/green opsin promoter. The efficacy of treatment was assessed periodically with photopic maze tests and electroretinographic (ERG) recordings for as long as 74 months postoperatively. Safety was assessed by repeated ophthalmic examinations and scotopic ERG recordings. The retinas of three animals that died of unrelated causes >5 years post-treatment were studied histologically and immunohistochemically using anti-hCNGA3 and anti-red/green cone opsin antibodies. Passage time and number of collisions of treated sheep in the photopic maze test were significantly lower at all follow-up examinations as compared with pretreatment values (p = 0.0025 and p < 0.001, respectively). ERG Critical Flicker Fusion Frequency and flicker amplitudes at 30 and 40 Hz showed significant improvement following treatment (p < 0.0001) throughout the study. Ophthalmic examinations and rod ERG recordings showed no abnormalities in the treated eyes. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of CNGA3 protein in red/green opsin-positive cells (cones) of the treated eyes. Our results show significant, long-term improvement in cone function, demonstrating a robust rescue effect up to six years following a single treatment with a viral vector that provides episomal delivery of the transgene. This unique follow-up duration confirms the safe and stable nature of AAV5 gene therapy in the ovine achromatopsia model.

AB Anew low-rank based framework has been proposed for simultaneous noise attenuation and data reconstruction, which uses an efficient algorithm for tracking subspaces from highly corrupted seismic observations. The online subspace tracking algorithm requires only basic linear algebraic manipulations. The algorithm is derived by analyzing incremental gradient descent on the Grassmannian manifold of subspaces. When the multidimensional seismic data is mapped to a low-rank space, the subspace tracking algorithm can be directly applied to the input low-rank matrix to estimate the useful signals. Since the proposed subspace tracking algorithm is an online algorithm, it is more robust to random noise than traditional singular value decomposition (SVD) based subspace tracking algorithm. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed reconstruction method can obtain better performance. More specifically, the proposed method outperforms the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method in causing less residual noise and also in saving half of the computational cost. Several synthetic and field data examples with different levels of complexities demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the presented algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Paleo-sedimentary environment of Chang 7 Member of Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation in Ordos Basin, including the paleoclimate, paleo-salinity and paleo-redox conditions were restored through geochemical elements analysis of 289 samples collected from the outcrop sections around and wells drilled in the basin and using a series of identification indexes of paleo-climate, paleo-salinity and paleo-redox conditions, such as CaO/MgO center dot Al2O3, Sr/Cu, Rb/Sr, Rb/K2O, Th/U, V/(V+ Ni), the content of element B tested from the mudstone. Comprehensive analysis shows that in sedimentary period of the Chang 7, the paleo-climate was warm temperate to subtropical climate with temperature higher than 15 degrees C, the water body was continental brackish water to freshwater, and the sediments were deposited under strong reduction conditions. Suitable temperature, extensively deep lake basin and strongly reductive paleo-sedimentary environment led to the blooming, enrichment and preservation of organic matter in the submember Chang 7(3). As a result, a set of high-quality source rock was formed, laying material foundation for large-scale accumulation of shale oil.

AB Objective: We compared bone mineral density (BMD) changes and their correlates, between men and women participating in two randomized trials of initial [antiretroviral therapy (ART)] regimens, with or without tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).
   Methods: Covariates in linear regression models of 48-week hip and spine %BMD changes, by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, included baseline and 48-week changes in plasma viral load, CD4(+) cells, plasma C-terminal telopeptide, procollagen 1 N-terminal propeptide and glomerular filtration rates, and the 48-week area under the curve of fractional excretion of phosphate.
   Results: Despite overall hip and spine BMD declines of 2.8 and 2.9%, respectively, plasma viral load suppression to less than 50 vs. at least 50 copies/ml was associated 1.0% (P = 0.02) and 0.8% (P = 0.01) less BMD decline. Women had lower baseline spine (P = 0.04; n = 59 women, 418 men) and hip BMD (P = 0.01) in adjusted models, with 1.7% more hip decline on ART than men (P = 0.001). Serum phosphate was positively associated with baseline spine BMD in women (P = 0.03) but not men, and area under the curve of fractional excretion of phosphate was negatively associated with spine BMD changes, particularly in women randomized to TDF regimens (P = 0.03 and 0.054 for interactions by sex, and randomization to TDF vs. non-TDF regimens, respectively; n = 44 women, 326 men). Women also had 0.6% (P = 0.004) more hip BMD decline than men associated with each 100 CD4(+) cells/mu l increase on ART (P = 0.02; n = 49 women, 379 men).
   Conclusion: Women randomized to TDF-containing ART had accentuated spine loss associated with phosphaturia, and accentuated hip loss associated with CD4(+) restoration, regardless of TDF exposure. Viral load suppression reduced bone loss. Copyright (C) 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soybean water is a common sizing agent that is used in the restoration of Chinese paintings and calligraphies. Heating soybean water leads to denaturation of soy protein and thus alters the hydrophobicity of paper after sizing. In this work, the change of surface hydrophobicity of soybean protein in the heating process was analyzed by 8-aniline-1-naphthlene sulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence probe. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was adopted to sort out different protein contents which later were identified by LC-MS/MS. The self. deconvolution and second derivative curve fitting techniques of attenuated total reflectance. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were used to analyze the change of secondary structures of soybean protein at different heating temperatures. ANS fluorescence probe experiment showed that the soybean water achieved its largest hydrophobicity when the temperature was 80 degrees C. The results of SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS revealed the disappearance of globulin glycinin G3 and glycoprotein lectin at high temperature. ATR-FTIR analysis showed that the increase of heating temperature of soybean water raised beta sheet content from 41. 14% to 48. 87% and the original alpha-helix, beta-turn and gamma-random structures shifted to beta sheet structure. There was a positive correlation between the structural content of beta sheet and the surface hydrophobicity. The research showed that the heating temperature of soybean milk at 80 degrees C was suitable for calligraphy and painting restoration.

AB Alleviating the staircase artifacts for variation method and adjusting the regularization parameters adaptively with the characteristics of different regions are two main issues in image restoration regularization process. An adaptive fractional-order total variation l(1) regularization (AFOTV-l(1)) model is proposed, which is resolved by using split Bregman iteration algorithm (SBI) for image estimation. An improved fractional-order differential kernel mask (IFODKM) with an extended degree of freedom (DOF) is proposed, which can preserve more image details and effectively avoid the staircase artifact. With the SBI algorithm adopted in this paper, fast convergence and small errors are achieved. Moreover, a novel regularization parameters adaptive strategy is given. Experimental results, by using the standard image library (SIL), the lung imaging database consortium and image database resource initiative (LIDC-IDRI), demonstrate that the proposed methods have better approximation, robustness and fast convergence performances for image restoration.

TI Tone Mapping for High Dynamic Range Image Using Modified Guided Filter
   and TV-based Restoration Model
SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
ID ICAM06
AB Up to now, a number of tone mapping methods have been proposed through a lot of literatures to reduce halos and to overcome loss of detailed information in a given high dynamic range image (HDRI) while reproducing colors. In these efforts, there are a wide variety of tone mapping techniques including global tone mapping technique, local tone mapping technique, and a combination of both techniques. However, there are still unsolved challenges such as halos, loss of detailed information, and color distortion like luminance shift and hue shift in the consequence of performing the conventional tone mapping methods. Accordingly, this article presents a novel approach to solving these problems by combining the modified guided filter method and the Total Variation (TV)-based restoration model, thereby comprising the proposed tone mapping operator. The main purpose of combining both is to decompose the HDRI into the base layer (illumination components) and the detail layer (reflectance components), which offers several advantages: removing noise and representing detailed information in resulting images. Adaptive gamma correction is also adopted to effectively reduce luminance shift and hue shift by automatically controlling the dynamic range, parameter free. The chromatic adaptation transform is then used to address the mismatch between displayed images and real-life scenes based on the human visual perception (HVP). The main contribution of the proposed approach is to overcome halos and loss of detailed information arising from the local tone mapping technique or the global tone mapping one. The experimental results show that the proposed tone mapping method yields better performance over the conventional method in subjective and quantitative qualities and color reproduction.

AB Objective To evaluate the effect of screw access hole design on the fracture resistance of cement-retained implant-supported zirconia-based restorations with screw access holes. Materials and Methods Thirty cement-retained implant-supported zirconia-based molar crown specimens were fabricated. The specimens were divided into 3 groups of 10: without access holes (C), with screw access holes (S), and with screw access holes accompanied with a surrounding zirconia wall (W). The veneering ceramic thickness was 0.8 mm in all groups. Implants were vertically mounted in a metal block. Abutments were screwed on the implants and the specimens were cemented to the abutments. A universal testing machine applied compressive forces to the specimens until fracture. Fracture resistance values of the specimens were measured. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD tests were used to analyze data (P < .05). Results The mean fracture resistance values were 5794.85 N for C, 2691.48 N for S, and 3878.06 N for W. The screw access hole design significantly affected the fracture resistance (P < .0001). Significant differences were found between C and S (P < .001), C and W (P < .001), and S and W (P = .026). Conclusions The screw access hole decreased the fracture resistance. A surrounding zirconia wall for the screw access hole increased the fracture resistance. Clinical Significance Screw access hole design may affect the fracture resistance of cement-retained implant-supported zirconia-based restorations with screw access holes. This study introduced a screw access hole design to improve the fracture resistance of these restorations.

ID IN-VITRO; SINGLE CROWNS; FILM THICKNESS; LUTING AGENTS; RETENTION;
   SCREW; STRENGTH; SURVIVAL; FORCE
AB Statement of problem. Retrievability of implant-supported restorations is important. Data are lacking for cemented zirconia crowns on zirconia abutments.
   Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of different cements and marginal discrepancy on the retrievability of implant-supported zirconia crowns. Furthermore, the influence of thermocycling on retrievability was evaluated.
   Materials and methods. Thirty tapered Camlog zirconia abutments (6-degree taper, 6x4.3 mm) were used. Thirty zirconia crowns with 3 different marginal cementation discrepancies (70, 130, 190 mu m) were fabricated by using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology. Five cements for interim or semidefinitive cementation were used: eugenol-free zinc oxide (Freegenol) and acrylurethane (ImProv) and 3 different composite resin cements (X-Pand Implant, Dyna Implant, Telio CS Cem Implant). Specimens underwent either 3-day storage in sodium chloride or thermocycling (10000 cycles). Crowns were removed by using a universal testing machine (UTM) and a clinical removal device. Data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and the Scheffe test (alpha=.05).
   Results. Thermocycling decreased the retention force significantly (P<.001). Marginal discrepancy (70 to 190 mu m) was not significantly influential on retrievability (P>.05). Therefore, groups were pooled according to the factor of marginal discrepancy. The mean retention force using the UTM after 3-day storage and thermocycling was as follows: Freegenol, 235 +/- 42 N (thermocycling, 29 +/- 9 N); Improv, 110 +/- 50 N (thermocycling, 35 +/- 38 N); Telio CS, 104 +/- 17 N (thermocycling, 6 +/- 10 N); Dyna implant, 61 +/- 17 N (thermocycling, 1 +/- 1 N); and X-Pand, 50 +/- 16 N (thermocycling, 2 +/- 2 N).
   Conclusions. Retention forces of the tested cements were significantly different and decreased considerably after thermocycling. Marginal cementation discrepancy between 70 and 190 mu m did not influence retrievability.

AB Habitat corridor construction is an important technique for re-establishing connections between fragmented habitats. Yet, the effectiveness of habitat corridors to increase gene flow among fragmented populations is not well studied. In 2008 and 2009. a prairie habitat corridor was created in the Green River watershed of south central Kentucky, USA to protect water quality and encourage movement of native wildlife as part of the US Environmental Protection Agency Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). In 2008, prior to the establishment of the habitat corridor, we documented the population genetic structure of 6 butterfly species (Chlosyne nycteis, Cupido comyntas, Phoebis sennae, Phyciodes tharos, Pterourus glaucus, and Pterourus tivilus) with different habitat requirements and different expected responses to corridor construction using Randomly Amplified DNA Fingerprint (RAF) markers. STRUCTURE analysis of these markers subdivided each butterfly species into 2 to 8 subpopulations in the Green River watershed. By collecting data in the early stages of habitat restoration, we have established a baseline to compare with data obtained after the corridor has matured to determine the population genetic effects on previously isolated butterfly populations and to provide information about the conservation value of habitat corridors in general.

   Protect Sanctuary Churches
SO YALE LAW JOURNAL
ID FREE EXERCISE; SMITH; ACCOMMODATION; COURTS; LAW
AB The last three decades have witnessed tectonic shifts in the doctrine and political valence of laws protecting religious exercise. In this Note, I analyze how this change has created the potential for sanctuary churches to receive greater legal protections today than during the 1980s sanctuary movement. This case study illustrates significant shifts in religious accommodation doctrine and helps to illuminate the transsubstantive nature of religious exercise protections. By drawing attention to sanctuary claims, this Note also helps to disrupt the existing partisan divide over religious freedom by reminding progressives of the potential value of RFRA claims for marginalized individuals, while highlighting to conservatives the importance of placing limits on religious accommodation claims. My hope is that this will motivate a return to an earlier consensus around accommodation as a means to protect systemically vulnerable groups and individuals in our society.

AB The restoration of the edentulous maxilla often requires augmentation before implantation can take place. For lateral augmentation, there is a wide range of procedures and materials available. Even literature does not provide a definite recommendation as to which procedure is most promising. In this case, it was not possible to avoid an additive augmentation by means of tilted implants or bone splitting. Therefore, allogenic and xenogeneic materials were used. The prosthe tic restoration was carried out with a screw-retained titanium framework composite bridge.

TI Gingival microleakage of class II bulk-fill composite resin restorations
SO DENTAL AND MEDICAL PROBLEMS
DE composite resin; microleakage; bulk-fill; dental restorations
ID MARGINAL ADAPTATION; CUSP DEFLECTION; DENTIN; PREMOLARS
AB Background. Bulk-fill composites were developed to simplify composite placement and minimize polymerization shrinkage stresses, which can improve gingival marginal adaptation in deep class II cavities.
   Objective. The objective of this study was to compare the gingival microleakage of class II cavities restored with bulk-fill composites to that of incrementally restored ones with a conventional composite at 2 storage periods.
   Material and methods. Forty freshly extracted intact molars were employed. Two standardized class II slot cavities, 3-millimeter-wide buccolingually, with the gingival floor 0.5 mm below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and the axial wall depth of 1.3 mm were prepared in each tooth (80 cavity preparations). The prepared teeth were divided equally into 3 bulk-fill groups (Tetric EvoCeram (R) Bulk Fill, X-tra Fil (R) and QuiXX (R)) and 1 control group (TPH Spectra (R) HV). Each group was subdivided into 2 equal subgroups (n = 10) according to the storage period in distilled water (24 h and 6 months). The Adper (R) Single Bond Plus adhesive was used with all the restorative materials.The cavities in the experimental groups were restored with 4-millimeter bulk-fill composites in 1 increment, while the cavities in the control group were restored with 2 increments of the thickness of 2 mm. The polymerization light was applied from the occlusal surfaces. The teeth were then immersed in 2% procion red dye solution, sectioned and examined under a stereomicroscopeto determine the extent of dye penetration. The data was statistically analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test.
   Result. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed no significant differences in the mean microleakage scores among all the groups after 24-hour and 6-month storage (p = 0.945 and p = 0.928, respectively). The Mann-Whitney U test revealed an increase in the mean microleakage scores in all the groups after 6-month storage; however, the scores were not significantly different from the means obtained after 24 h (p = 0.259 for Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill; p = 0.205 for X-tra Fil;p = 0.166 for QuiXX; p = 0.155 for TPH Spectra HV).
   Conclusion. Gingival microleakage of bulk-fill composites in class II cavities was not significantly different from that of incrementally restored ones with a conventional composite. The increase in the mean gingival microleakage of the specimens stored for 6 months was not a statistically significant difference as compared to the values obtained after the 24-hour storage for each composite.

Materials and method 59 composite resins posterior restorations, from 15 patients, were assessed based on FDI criteria. Data were statistically analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2007. Results The study found a high percent of the assessed direct restorations with good and excellent esthetic, functional and biological FDI criteria. For the restorations with satisfactory FDI criteria it was indicated minimal invasive repair technique, and for the restorations with poor FDI criteria it was indicated replacement. Conclusions The clinical assessment criteria help dentists to decide the use of minimal invasive repair interventions, thus prolonging the functional, anatomical, esthetic durability of aesthetic posterior direct restorations.

AB Many studies around the globe have identified plant production facilities as major sources of plant pathogens that may be released in the wild, with significant consequences for the health and integrity of natural ecosystems. Recently, a large number of soilborne and waterborne species belonging to the plant pathogenic genus Phytophthora have been identified for the first time in California native plant production facilities, including those focused on the production of plant stock used in ecological restoration efforts. Additionally, the same Phytophthora species present in production facilities have often been identified in failing restoration projects, further endangering plant species already threatened or endangered. To our knowledge, the identification of Phytophthora species in restoration areas and in plant production facilities that produce plant stock for restoration projects is a novel discovery that finds many land managers unprepared, due to a lack of previous experience with these pathogens. This review summarizes some of the key knowledge about the genus Phytophthora in general and lists some of the many soilborne and waterborne species recently recovered from some California restoration sites and plant production facilities

AB Purpose: The ideal digital cement space value for the fabrication of provisional computer-aided design/ computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) crowns with clinically acceptable marginal adaptation is not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different simulated cement space settings on the marginal tit of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) provisional CAD/CAM restorations. Materials and Methods: An extracted premolar tooth was prepared using ceramic crown preparation guidelines and represented both natural teeth and/or custom implant abutments. The prepared tooth abutment was scanned with a three-dimensional (3D) laboratory scanner (D900, 3Shape). CAD design software was used to subsequently design a premolar crown core with three different simulated cement space settings (20 to 40 mu m, 20 to 50 mu m, 20 to 60 mu m). PMMA blocks were used to mill the specimens (n = 9, N = 27). Using a stereo zoom microscope, a total of 36 images for each of the 3 groups (9 crowns per group, 4 sites per crown) were captured to measure the mean vertical marginal discrepancy for every group. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data, and the post hoc Tukey multiple comparison test was performed. Results: The marginal gap values of the PMMA cores fabricated using the three cement space settings were significantly different from each other (P < .001). The marginal gap was smaller with a 20- to 60-mu m setting compared with 20 to 50 mu m and 20 to 40 mu m, and the 20- to 50-mu m setting allowed for smaller marginal gaps compared with 20 to 40 mu m (P < .001). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the marginal gaps of CAD/CAM-fabricated PMMA cores were smaller when the cement space was larger. The smallest marginal gaps were achieved when a 20- to 60-mu m cement space was used (P < .001).

SO HISPANIA-REVISTA ESPANOLA DE HISTORIA
DE anticlericalism; press; moral panic; paedophile priests; Restoration
AB This article analyses the campaign promoted by the anticlerical republican press in Restoration Spain against the abuses committed by "paedophile" priests. Based on approximately 400 news items on the subject, taken from the anticlerical press of the time (1880-1912), a total of 151 cases related to pederasty abuses perpetrated by the clergy have been verified. The methodology used is based on the American sociology of "moral panics". After introducing the problem, the sources and chronology, the phases that mark the construction process of this moral panic regarding pederast priests are delineated. Attention is then drawn to the parallelism between the aforementioned journalistic campaign and the growing anticlerical offensive between 1898 and 1912. Finally, the journalistic crusade against paedophile priests is analysed as a political catalyst for struggles that also involve the domination of gender, age and social class.

AB A problem of restoration of a blurred image obtained by a horizontally rotating camera is considered in this paper. The mathematical model of this problem is the convolution equation on a cyclic group. In the previous papers of the authors, the case of a non-singular equation was considered. The general case that admits the degeneracy of the convolution equation is considered in this paper. An algorithm is developed based on which a fast program for recovering blurred images is written. The complexity of the algorithm presented in this paper for the degenerate convolution equation is the same as for the non-singular case. The analysis of calculation errors affecting the image quality is given. The influence of the errors of the algorithm's initial data for a degenerate equation is not higher than for a non-singular case.

AB Peculiarities that used to distinguish the organization and government of the Royal Houses and their departments in the past, were diluted under Fernando VII. As shown in this article, both the Court as political system and the House as monarchy representation faced a crisis after 1808 and under Jose I and the Regency government.
   Just as the Royal House, the Chapel had to make progress and to adapt to the events that shook the political, economic and social life of the country between 1808 and 1814. Upon the return of Fernando VII, there were certain readjustments in the government department and the individuals that made it up. To a certain extent, the reports of political behavior reconfigured this department becoming essentials to preserve, return or access government positions. Nevertheless, in spite of the importance that they had, could we speak of a process of persecution and cleansing of those whose fidelity had been compromised during Fernando VII absence?

Patients in the other group received one non-occluding provisional acrylic reinforced prosthesis within 24 h of implant placement. Provisional prostheses were replaced by definitive ones after 4 months. The follow-up for all patients was 3 years post-loading. Outcome measures were prosthesis and implant failures, any complications, peri-implant marginal bone level changes, aesthetic evaluation by a dental practitioner, patient satisfaction, chair time and number of visits at the dental office from implant placement to delivery of definitive restorations.
   Results: Three patients dropped out, one from the non-occlusal group and two from the occlusal group. Two immediately occlusally loaded implants with their related definitive prostheses failed early (difference in proportions = 0.10; 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.23; P = 0.488). Five patients from the occlusally loaded group were affected by six complications vs three patients (three complications) in the non-occlusally loaded group. The difference in proportions was not statistically significant (difference in proportions = 0.08; 95% CI = -0.17 to 0.34; P = 0.697). Three years after loading, patients subjected to occlusal loading lost an average of 1.13 mm of peri-implant bone vs 1.03 mm of patients restored with non-occluding definitive partial fixed prostheses. There were no statistically significant differences for marginal bone level changes between the two groups (mean difference = 0.10 mm; 95% CI -0.62 to 0.82; P = 0.779). No significant were the differences for pink aesthetic scores (7.09 vs 6.90; P = 0.873); for aesthetics evaluated by patients (Mann-Whitney U test P = 0.799) and function satisfaction (Mann-Whitney U test P = 0.578). Significantly less chair time (mean difference -38.00; 95% CI -58.96 to -17.04; P = 0.001) and number of visits (mean difference -2.15; 95% CI -2.77 to -1.53; P < 0.001) were required for the immediate definitive prosthesis group.
   Conclusions: This study did not provide a conclusive answer, but suggests that immediate occlusal loading by manufacturing immediate definitive partial fixed prostheses decreases chair time and number of visits.

AB The choice of native species in the recovery of degraded areas is important because of the peculiar relation with the sites where they were established and specific nutritional requirements. The nutrient utilization efficiency of these species can contribute to recommendations of their use in degraded areas of the Atlantic Forest. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the N, P, K, Ca, and Mg nutrient concentrations of native species in a remnant of Lowland Dense Shade Forest, to estimate foliar biomass; to calculate the stored nutrients and the nutrient utilization efficiency. A phytosociological study of the fragment was carried out and the ten species with the highest absolute densities were defined. The forest species presented high content of N and low of P, being able to be established in environments rich in N and low in P, with the exception of Myrcia silvatica and Tapirira guianensis, which can be recommended for soils with low N availability. Thyrsodium spruceanum and Protium heptaphyllum can be recommended for environments with low K and Mg availability, respectively. Brosimum rubescens can be used for forest restoration in fragments of soils with low Ca availability. The nutrient utilization efficiency may indicate a nutritionally balanced forest fragment, diversified and established.

AB Background: Pressure changes can affect dental restorations especially in divers. The aim of the present study was to assess the fracture resistance and Micro-leakage of the MOD restorations using three types of composite resins undergoing pressure changes, simulating SCUBA-diving and aviation. Methods: For fracture resistance test 90 sound maxillary premolar teeth were randomly assigned to 3 groups of 30 MOD composite restorations using three types of composite resins (nanohybride 3M Z350, microhybride 3M Z250, packable 3M P60) were prepared. Each group was then divided to 3 subgroups of 10 for simulating SCUBA-diving (2 bar pressure cycle), Flight (0.5 bar pressure cycle) and control (atmosphere pressure). The teeth undergone pressure cycles for 1 month and then fracture resistance test was conducted on them using instron testing machine. For Micro-leakage test the same subgroups were made using 90 mandibular premolars (n=10) and using 2% Methylene blue dye for 24 hours Micro-leakage scores were recorded. Data were analyzed statistically. Result: In regard of the fracture resistance test packable composite resines had significantly higher scores than nanohybride and microhybride composite resins (p-value<0.05). Control group had significantly higher fracture resistance values in comparison to Dive groups whereas there was no significant difference between control and Flight group. (p-value=0.083). Considering Micro-leakage there was no significant difference between three restorative materials or between three pressure groups. Conclusion: Packable composite resins show grater fracture toughness than micro and nanohybride composite resins. Diving pressure cycles demonstrated to have adverse effect on fracture resistance amounts of all three types of composite resins.

There is a three-bay portico on northern side of the mosque, built on a square base. There are wall paintings/decorations dated various periods inside the mosque. The mosque has been repaired and made alterations many times since it was constructed in the 16 th century. Especially with the outburst of Balkan Wars in 1912 and resultant withdrawal of Ottomans from the region, Muslims fell into minority and the building was abandoned to its faith. The mosque was used for various purposes for many times. Together with broken pieces of minbar, gravestones collected all around Bitola was were piled up inside the building that was later abandoned and vandalized. Along with fieldworks conducted during the restoration process of the mosque, which constituted the primary method of the study, related literature, archival, and historical research have also been conducted during the study. The repairs were presented under following headings; consolidation/strengthening, cleaning, completion, reconstruction, conservation of decorations/wall paintings. Landscaping, and conservation of gravestones has also been explained. The basic approach in conservation applications and project works has been to preserve the original and different period additions reflecting original construction techniques, materials and architectural elements, clean unoriginal additions and structural strengthening. Pre-restoration deteriorations of building, findings and depictions related to architectural details, decorations, wall paintings discovered during the repairs have been shared with scientific world. Previous restoration interventions and the effect of historical, ethnical, and cultural identity of the region on architecture and decorations have also been evaluated. This research is also important in terms of exchange of knowledge and experience between Turkish and Macedonian preservation experts.

   Nitrosomonas Eutropha in the Treatment of Keratosis Pilaris: A
   Randomized Clinical Trial
SO JOURNAL OF DRUGS IN DERMATOLOGY
ID NITRIC-OXIDE; PROLIFERATION
AB Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a common skin finding that presents as follicular hyperkeratotic papules on the proximal extremities in patients with a propensity for atopy. Although often asymptomatic, the stippled appearance is cosmetically disturbing to patients and difficult to treat as current therapies are limited in availability and efficacy. Nitric oxide (NO) has been found to be essential in basic systemic and cutaneous physiologic function, specifically in terms of its anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties, which evolutionarily was maintained by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). As modern hygiene practices have improved, there has been a gradual loss of cutaneous AOB and, therefore, the availability of an important source of human physiologic NO. We propose that restoring this dermal microflora with a purified strain of AOB, Nitrosomonas eutropha (D23), may reduce the overall cutaneous inflammatory state and, thus, be a potential therapeutic option for improving the cosmetic appearance of a skin condition such as KP which is often found in association with xerosis and atopic dermatitis.

AB Long DRAM access latency is a major bottleneck for system performance. In order to access data in DRAM, a memory controller (1) activates (Le., opens) a row of DRAM cells in a cell array, (2) restores the charge in the activated cells back to their full level, (3) performs read and write operations to the activated row and (4) precharges the cell array to prepare for the next activation. The restoration operation is responsible for a large portion (up to 43.6%) of the total DRAM access latency.
   We find two frequent cases where the restoration operations performed by DRAM do not need to fully restore the charge level of the activated DRAM cells, which we can exploit to reduce the restoration latency. First, DRAM rows are periodically refreshed (Le., brought back to full charge) to avoid data loss due to charge leakage from the cell. The charge level of a DRAM row that will be refreshed soon needs to be only partially restored, providing just enough charge so that the refresh can correctly detect the cells' data values. Second, the charge level of a DRAM row that will be activated again soon can. be only partially restored, providing just enough charge for the activation to correctly detect the data value. However, partial restoration needs to be done carefully: for a row that will be activated again soon, restoring to only the minimum possible charge level can undermine the benefits of complementary mechanisms that reduce the activation time of highly-charged rows.
   To enable effective latency reduction for both activation and restoration, we propose charge-level-aware look-ahead partial restoration (CAL). CAL consists of two key components. First, CAL accurately predicts the next access time, which is the time between the current restoration operation and the next activation of the same row. Second, CAL uses the predicted next access time and the next refresh time to reduce the restoration time, ensuring that the amount of partial charge restoration is enough to maintain the benefits of reducing the activation time of a highly-charged row. We implement CAL fully in the memory controller, without any changes to the DRAM module. Across a wide variety of applications, we find that CAL improves the average performance of an 8-core system by 14.7%, and reduces average DRAM energy consumption by 11.3%.

DE Secure Architecture; Non-volatile Memory; ECC; Computer Architecture
AB With Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) beginning to enter the mainstream computing market, it is time to consider how to secure NVM-equipped computing systems. Recent Melt-down and Spectre attacks are evidence that security must be intrinsic to computing systems and not added as an afterthought. Processor vendors are taking the first steps and are beginning to build security primitives into commodity processors. One security primitive that is associated with the use of emerging NVMs is memory encryption. Memory encryption, while necessary, is very challenging when used with NVMs because it exacerbates the write endurance problem.
   Secure architectures use cryptographic metadata that must be persisted and restored to allow secure recovery of data in the event of power-loss. Specifically, encryption counters must be persistent to enable secure and functional recovery of an interrupted system. However, the cost of ensuring and maintaining persistence for these counters can be significant. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to maintain encryption counters without the need for frequent updates. Our new memory controller design, Osiris, repurposes memory Error-Correction Codes (ECCs) to enable fast restoration and recovery of encryption counters. To evaluate our design, we use GemS to run eight memory-intensive workloads selected from SPEC2006 and U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) proxy applications. Compared to a write-through counter-cache scheme, on average, Osiris can reduce 48.7% of the memory writes (increase lifetime by 1.95x), and reduce the performance overhead from 51.5% (for write-through) to only 5.8%. Furthermore, without the need for backup battery or extra power-supply hold-up time, Osiris performs better than a battery backed write-back (5.8% vs. 6.6% overhead) and has less write traffic (2.6% vs. 5.9% overhead).

   STRESS
AB Objective. Dibornol-HES, a water-soluble drug based on the derivative of 2,6-diisobornyl-4-methylphenol Dibornol conjugated with hydroxyethyl starch, can reduce the occurrence and severity of arrhythmias by preventive intravenous administration, but it is unknown whether the drug could reduce the myocardial arrhythmogenicity once ischemia has developed at the developed ischemia.
   Materials and methods. In the model of acute ischemia / reperfusion of the rabbit heart, the effect of Dibornol-HEC (80 mg/kg body weight of the animal) on the electrophysiological indices characterizing myocardial arrhythmogenicity (global and border dispersion of repolarization) was studied during the restoration of blood flow. In the model of acute ischemia / reperfusion with 64 unipolar epicardial leads, the activation-recovery intervals were measured and global and border dispersion of repolarization in the native rabbits (control group, n = 9) and in the rabbits treated by Dibornol-HES (on the 25th minute of occlusion, the experimental group, n = 6).
   Results. The introduction of Dibornol-HES did not lead to a change in the electrocardiographic parameters of rabbits. By the 30th minute of the coronary occlusion on the ECG in the animals of the control and the experimental groups, the intervals RR, QT, QTc were shortened (p < 0.05). In the animals of both groups by the 30th minute of coronary occlusion, the global dispersion of repolarization increased (p < 0.05), the boundary dispersion of repolarization also increased (p < 0.05), due to the decrease in the duration of the activation-recovery intervals in the ischemic zone (p < 0.05). During the 30-minute reperfusion the magnitude of the global dispersion of repolarization did not change in animals of the both groups, and the magnitude of the border dispersion of repolarization in the control rabbits decreased (p < 0.05), while in the rabbits treated by Dibornol-HES the border dispersion of repolarization did not changed.
   Conclusion. In rabbits of the experimental group, the values of the global and border dispersions of repolarization did not differ from those of the animals in the control group. Therefore, the administration to Dibornol-HES just prior to reperfusion does not lead to the decrease in the dispersion of repolarization increased as a result of acute ischemic myocardial damage.

AB Introduction: Investigating methods to decrease microleakage can improve the durability of composite resin restorations. Aims: Evaluating the effect of surface treatments with Er:YAG (Erbium:Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet) laser and chlorhexidine (CHX) prior to a self-etching adhesive on microleakage of class V composite restorations after a 6-months water storage.
   Materials and Methods: Class-V cavities were prepared at the cement-enamel-junction of sound premolars (n=16). The study groups were as follows: control (C), 2% CHX application, Er:YAG laser treatment (2940 nm wavelength, 10 Hz pulse repetition rate, 0.5 W power) prior to bonding (Er), and after six months of water storage as follows: CW, CHXW, ErW. After application of Bond Force adhesive (Tokoyama Corp.), the cavities were restored with light-cured composite. The samples were stored in fuschin and marginal microleakage was assessed immediately and after six months of water storage. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney-U tests (p<0.05). Results and
   Discussion: CHX or laser had no significant effect on dentin and enamel marginal microleakage of restorations (P>0.05). Six months of water storage had no significant effect on microleakage at dentin and enamel margins (P>0.05). Microleakage at the enamel margins was lower than dentin margins before and after water storage (P=0.001).
   Conclusion: Er:YAG laser or 2% CHX prior to the adhesive application had no effect on microleakage of class-V composite restorations.

   Materials and Methods: Class II preparations were made in 40 extracted molar teeth. The teeth were divided into four groups: fully current resin composite, flow composite associated with current resin composite, glass ionomer associated with current resin composite, amalgam associated with current resin composite. Groups 2, 3, and 4 were filled as combined restorations (sandwich technique). The images on film, charge-coupled device (CCD) digital systems, and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were evaluated by two examiners and the data were achieved. The systems for obtaining images presented were similar for each material. The data were analyzed according to ANOVA and Kendall's tau-b, Kruskal-Wallis, Exact, and Fisher's exact tests were applied.
   Results: Amalgam had the highest radiopacity among the materials being tested (equivalent to 9 mm Aluminium). The groups 2 and 3 ranked next (equivalent to 8 mm Al). Group 1 had the lowest radiopacity among the materials being tested (equivalent to 7 mm Al). All groups were more radiopaque than enamel (enamel=6 mm Al).
   Conclusion: Radiopacity rates were as follows: Amalgam>flow glass ionomer>current composite>enamel>dentin. According to this study amalgam, between the said combined composite restorations, has the maximum radiopacity in deep class II cavities with these three imaging systems.

DE Dunhuang mural restoration; deep learning; generative adversarial
   network
AB As time goes by, the art pieces inside Dunhuang Grottoes have suffered from tremendous damage such as mural deterioration, and they are usually difficult to be repaired. Although we can achieve digital preservation by modeling the caves and preserving mural as textures in virtual environment, we still cannot have a glimpse of how the grottoes look like without damage. In this work, we propose a systematic restoration framework, which is based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) technique, for these high-resolution but deteriorated mural textures. The main idea is to make the machine learn the transformation between deteriorated mural textures and restored mural textures. However, the resolution of training texture images (i.e. 8192x8192) is too high to be applied with GAN technology directly due to GPU RAM limitation. Instead, our method restores a set of high-resolution yet color-inconsistent textures patch-by-patch and a set of low-resolution but color-consistent full textures, and then combines them to get the final high-resolution and color-consistent result.

AB The electrical power supply consistency is one of the main power quality and network reliability indices. Generally, distribution networks have radial structures. In such a situation, when a fault occurs in one of the network feeders which leads to isolating the fault, downstream loads may be de energized. The change of network structure with the aim of delivering the high quality and reliable energy to the customers is an important parameter in distribution network operation, which is called the network loads restoration. In distribution networks, there are switches that are normally open, and it is possible to create new paths for de-energized loads by closing them. These switches are called tie switches. Quick and efficient restoration of de-energized loads increases the network reliability and consumer satisfaction level, and decreases the undistributed energy and costs. In this paper, an efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed to maximize the restoration of distribution network loads, and the Genetic algorithm is used for minimum load elimination when it is not possible to restore all loads. Furthermore, proposed algorithm performance and accuracy is validated by implementing it on IEEE 33-bus standard network.

The procedure relies on the comprehensive lexical resources for Serbian: the morphological electronic dictionaries, the Corpus of Contemporary Serbian and local grammars. Dictionaries are used to identify possible candidates for the restoration, while the data obtained from SrpKor and local grammars assists in making a decision between several candidates in cases of ambiguity. The evaluation results reveal that, depending on the text, accuracy ranges from 95.03% to 99.36%, while the precision (average 98.93%) is always higher than the recall (average 94.94%).

DE Image restoration; super-resolution; convolutional nets; deep learning;
   complexity of training and test datasets
AB Many papers have recently been published on image restoration and single-image super-resolution (SISR) using different deep neural network architectures, training methodology, and datasets. The standard approach for performance evaluation in these papers is to provide a single "average" mean-square error (MSE) and/or structural similarity index (SSIM) value over a test dataset. Since deep learning is data-driven, performance of the proposed methods depends on the size of the training and test sets as well as the variety and complexity of images in them. Furthermore, the performance varies across different images within the same test set. Hence, comparison of different architectures and training methods using a single average performance measure is difficult, especially when they are not using the same training and test sets. We propose new measures to characterize the variety and complexity of images in the training and test sets, and show that our proposed dataset complexity measures correlate well with the mean PSNR and SSIM values obtained on different test data sets. Hence, better characterization of performance of different methods is possible if the mean and variance of the MSE or SSIM over the test set as well as the size, resolution and complexity measures of the training and test sets are specified.

The restoration problem is formulated in a Bayesian framework and several state-of-the-art Monte Carlo samplers are considered to estimate the unknown image and quantify its uncertainty. The different samplers are compared through a series of experiments conducted with synthetic images. The results demonstrate the scaling properties of the proposed samplers as the dimensionality of the problem increases and the number of photons decreases. Moreover, our experiments show that for a certain photon budget (i.e., acquisition time of the imaging device), downsampling the observations can yield better reconstruction results.

AB This paper proposes a new algorithm to restore 3D single-photon Lidar images obtained under challenging realistic scenarios which include imaging multilayered targets such as semi-transparent surfaces or imaging through obscurants such as scattering media (e.g., water, fog). The Data restoration and exploitation is achieved by minimising an appropriate cost-function accounting for the data Poisson statistics and the available prior knowledge regarding the depth and reflectivity estimates. The proposed algorithm takes into account (i) the non-local spatial correlations between pixels, by using a convex non-local total variation (TV) regularizer, and (ii) the clustered nature of the returned photons, by using a collaborative sparse prior. The resulting minimization problem is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that offers good convergence properties. The algorithm is validated using both synthetic and real data which show the benefit of the proposed strategy in the sparse regime due to a fast acquisition or in presence of a high background due to obscurants.

AB We propose a novel total variation based image restoration method that combines first and second order total variation functionals in a structurally adaptive manner. Specifically, as opposed to recent practical combined order methods, which choose the relative weight between the functionals of different derivative orders as a global scalar parameter, we construct a functional that uses a spatially varying relative weight between functionals of different orders so as to adapt to the local image structure. Further, as opposed to known combined order methods which leave the relative weight as a user parameter, the proposed method automatically computes the relative weight using a novel multi-resolution based formulation. The proposed spatially adaptive combined order TV (SAMTV) performs better than the state of art total generalized variation (TGV) method in experiments.

AB This paper studies a new ultrasound image restoration method based on a non-linear forward model. A Hammerstein polynomial-based non-linear image formation model is considered to identify the system impulse response in baseband and around the second harmonic. The identification process is followed by a joint deconvolution technique minimizing an appropriate cost function. This cost function is constructed from two data fidelity terms exploiting the linear and non-linear model components, penalized by an additive l(1)-norm regularization enforcing sparsity of the solution. An alternating optimization approach is considered to minimize the penalized cost function, allowing the tissue reflectivity function to be estimated. Results on synthetic ultrasound images are finally presented to evaluate the algorithm performance.

AB Image acquisition in many biomedical imaging modalities is corrupted by Poisson noise followed by additive Gaussian noise. MLE based restoration methods that use the exact Likelihood function for this mixed model with non-quadratic regularization are very few. While it has been demonstrated that total variation (TV) based regularization methods give better results, such methods that use exact Poisson-Gaussian Likelihood are slow. Here, we propose an ADMM based fast algorithm for image restoration using exact Poisson-Gaussian Likelihood function and TV regularization. Specifically, we propose a novel variable splitting approach that enables isolating the complexity in the exact MLE functional from the image blurring operation, allowing a fast Newton-like iteration on the MLE functional. This leads to a significantly improved convergence rate of the overall ADMM iteration. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using restoration examples.

In this paper, we propose a novel PSF estimation method utilizing total variation regularization, a shock filter, and the gradient degree of reliability for non-uniform blurred images. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method delivers the best performance of the currently available methods with respect to deblurring performance. Furthermore, the processing time for our proposed method is very short, and clear images are obtained for actual (real-life) pictures.

AB Restoration/restorativeness is defined as the recovery of diminished daily functions and capabilities, largely during people's free time. Research on recovery requires measurements of the degree of restoration/restorativeness, driving the development of self-report scales on recovery. This study reviews existing self-report restoration/restorativeness scales based on PICOS (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, and study design) and psychometrics to provide suggestions for future applications. Systematic search methods and a simple snowball process were conducted for the direct and explicit self-report scales on restoration/restorativeness published in journal articles. The Web of Science was used as the database. Among the identified 15 scales, only 3 have been adequately analyzed using psychometrics. Of these 3, the Perceived Restorativeness Scale has the best generalizability and sensitivity for measuring the attentional restorativeness perceived in the environment, while the Restoration Scale is most suitable for measuring the perceived change in psychophysiological and mental restoration.

ID CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT; FEATURES
AB Image matching is widely used in visual-based navigation systems, most of which simply assume the ideal inputs without considering the degradation of the real world, such as image blur. In presence of such situation, the traditional matching methods first resort to image restoration and then perform image matching with the restored image. However, by treating the restoration and matching separately, the accuracy of image matching will be reduced by the defective output of the image restoration. In this paper, we propose a joint image restoration and matching method based on distance-weighted sparse representation (JRM-DSR), which utilizes the sparse representation prior to exploit the correlation between restoration and matching. This prior assumes that the blurry image, if correctly restored, can be well represented as a sparse linear combination of the dictionary constructed by the reference image. In order to achieve more accurate matching results to help restoration, we consider both local and sparse information and adopt distance-weighted sparse representation to obtain better representation coefficients. By iteratively restoring the input image in pursuit of the sparest representation, our approach can achieve restoration and matching simultaneous, and these two tasks can benefit greatly from each other. matching, we give a coarse to fine matching strategy to further improve the matching accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with conventional methods.

AB Sea surface temperature(SST) satellite images are often partially occluded by clouds. Image inpainting is one approach to restore the occluded region. Considering the sparseness of SST images, they can be restored via learning-based inpainting. However, state-of-the-art learning-based inpainting methods using deep neural networks require large amount of non-occluded images as a training set. Since most SST images contain occluded regions, it is hard to collect sufficient non-occluded images. In this paper, we propose a novel method that uses occluded images as training images hence we can enlarge the amount of available training images from a certain SST image set. This is realized by comprising a novel reconstruction loss and adversarial loss. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method.

AB Inserting proper punctuation into Automatic Speech Recognizer(ASR) transcription is a challenging and promising task in real-time Spoken Language Translation(SLT). Traditional methods built on the sequence labelling framework are weak in handling the joint punctuation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel self-attention based network, which can solve the aforementioned problem very well. In this work, a light-weight neural net is proposed to extract the hidden features based solely on self-attention without any Recurrent Neural Nets(RNN) and Convolutional Neural Nets(CNN). We conduct extensive experiments on complex punctuation tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements on joint punctuation task while being superior to traditional methods on simple punctuation task as well.

AB Image local structural prior and non-local self-similarity (NSS) prior are two categories of priors which have been commonly used for solving the ill-posed image restoration problem. As they exploit different properties of the natural images, it is interesting to investigate whether the two categories of priors can be combined to achieve better restoration performance. Inspired by recently proposed Regularization by denoising [1] idea, we propose LNIR which incorporates a Local CNN denoiser prior and a NSS-based denoiser prior implicitly for Image Restoration. Our experimental results on the image deblurring and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed LNIR algorithm can not only flexibly adapt to different restoration tasks, but also delivers state-of-the-art restoration results.

AB The denoising and deblurring of images are the two essential restoration tasks in the document image processing task. As the preprocessing stages of the processing pipeline, the quality of denoising and deblurring heavily influences the result of subsequent tasks, such as character detection and recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel neural method for restoring document images. We named our network Skip-Connected Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (SCDCA), which is composed of multiple layers of convolution followed by a batch normalization layer and the leaky rectified linear unit (Leaky ReLU) activation function. Inspired by the idea of residual learning, we use two types of skip connections in the network. One is identity mapping between convolution layers and the other is used to connect the input and output. Through these connections, the network learns the residual between the noisy and clean images instead of learning an ordinary transformation function. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on an open and challenging document images dataset. We also assess our restoring results using the optical character recognition (OCR) test. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods.

AB Recovering information from contrast-limited, SNR-limited, color-attenuated images in a scattering media is of paramount importance for the autonomous functioning of robotic agents. The task is challenging due to the transient state of the medium, unknown medium parameters and in many cases the need for fully autonomous operation. This work presents a target-less, calibration-less method for restoring underwater light field images and requires no explicit model of the medium. The method adopts a light-field imaging approach to capture, model and compensate for backscatter in the scene leading to the recovery of high-fidelity images. The proposed method for backscatter compensation is validated against other state-of-the-art methods and is demonstrated to yield superior image quality.

DE regularization; patch; ADMM; deblurring; super-resolution
AB Several patch-based models have been proposed for image restoration in the literature. A common feature with these models is that patches are used for filtering or optimization, where the aggregation is often performed over a non-local (NL) neighborhood. We propose a NL patch-based regularizer, where patches are used (1) for computing weights between NL neighbors, and (2) for defining a TV-type norm in patch space. A general form of the latter construction was originally proposed by Peyre et al. and later studied by other authors. In most of these proposals, both the weights and the image are treated as variables, which makes the model non-convex. In particular, the corresponding numerical solvers cannot guarantee local optimality. On the other hand, our regularizer is convex. Along with an l(2) data fidelity term, we apply the regularizer for denoising, deblurring and super-resolution, and develop an efficient ADMM solver for computing the global minimum. An interesting finding is that, while our model is weaker than the non-convex counterparts, the minimizer of the former is generally closer to the ground truth than the reconstruction from the latter. Moreover, we demonstrate that our regularizer can outperform existing regularization techniques for deblurring and super-resolution.

AB In this paper, we tackle the problem of restoring unevenly illuminated images. Generally, there exist three kinds of exposure conditions in these images: under-, normal-, and over-exposures. Thus, a three-component generalized Gaussian mixture model (3GGMM) is used to fit the histogram of the illuminance image, and probabilistically characterize the three exposure states. Based on the 3GGMM, separate optimal tone mapping functions are designed to enhance under- and overexposed regions by maximizing expected contrast of these regions. The output illumination can be obtained by fusing the restoration results in different exposure states. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed image restoration approach.

The overall cost function is assumed strongly convex. Each involved function is associated with a node of a hypergraph having the ability to communicate with neighboring nodes sharing the same hyperedge. Our algorithm relies on a primal-dual splitting strategy with established convergence guarantees. We show how it can be efficiently implemented to take full advantage of a multicore architecture. The good numerical performance of the proposed approach is illustrated in a problem of video sequence denoising, where a significant speedup is achieved.

DE Spectral distortion; restoration; underwater images; colour correction
AB Light undergoes a wavelength-dependent attenuation and loses energy along its propagation path in water. In particular, the absorption of red wavelengths is greater than that of green and blue wavelengths in open ocean waters. This reduces the red intensity of the scene radiance reaching the camera and results in non-uniform light, known as background light, due to the scene depth. Restoration methods that compensate for this colour loss often assume constant background light and distort the colour of the water region(s). To address this problem, we propose a restoration method that compensates for the colour loss due to the scene-to-camera distance of non-water regions without altering the colour of pixels representing water. This restoration is achieved by ensuring background light candidates are selected from pixels representing water and then estimating the non-uniform background light without prior knowledge of the scene depth. Experimental results shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in preserving the colour of water regions.

AB Images captured in underwater (UW) are often disturbed with several kind of degradation such as low visibility, non-uniform color cast, haze, and blurriness. To date, most UW image restoration methods have ignored the effects of sensor blur and noise. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel three stage algorithm for visibility recovery in UW images by considering both sensor blur and noise. In the first stage, blind deconvolution is used for the estimation of an unknown point spread function (PSF). In the second stage, a new prior called weighted median channel prior (WMCP) is used for the estimation of scene depth and background light. In the third stage, a color balancing (CB) module is adopted to minimize the effect of non-uniform color cast. Experimental results manifest that the proposed algorithm is effective and has the character of visibility improvement, and color correction than previous state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this paper, a control strategy is proposed for both accurate current sharing among distributed generators (DGs) and the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage restoration in low voltage direct current (LVDC) microgrid by injecting a small AC signal to the output voltage of the DG. The small AC signal frequency changes proportionally to the per unit (pu) output current of the corresponding DG, and the DG output voltage is regulated to share every DG with the equivalent frequency in the steady state. Especially, for easy implementation, the reactive power of the AC signal is controlled to indirectly regulate the AC signal frequency. Moreover, the equivalent pu output current is used to determine the voltage shift-up in order to restore the PCC voltage. Because the proposed control scheme is developed with the fully distributed manner at local controller for each DG, it can be implemented economically without external communication network. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is proved by the simulation.

Appropriate sizing of ESS is crucial to ensure successful service restoration, prior to re-transfer of loads to the utility or main power source. In this paper, the load behavior of an islanded microgrid during different stages of power restoration has been modeled to estimate the capacity of the ESS. For estimating the power and energy requirement for the restoration process, we considered a soft-restart method instead of the conventional top-down approach or, a conventional bottom-up restoration approach of power restoration. We have characterized different facilities by the percentage of motor loads vs the non-motor loads within the facility. The method can serve as a valuable tool during initial stages of ESS sizing and microgrid design

AB Envelope tracking (ET) and envelope elimination and restoration (EER) are crucial techniques which can significantly improve the efficiency of radio frequency power amplification (RFPA) system in RF communication applications. The two techniques gain more and more attention and progress in recent years, benefitting from the excellent switching characteristic of wide band-gap power devices. Envelope amplifier (EA), a high bandwidth DC/DC converter, is entailed in both techniques to precisely amplify the envelope of communication RF signal. This paper proposes a modular cascaded multilevel Buck converter operating as EA for high power envelope elimination and restoration applications. PWM modulation and capacitor voltage balance control methods are investigated. In addition, a half-bridge circuit cell (HBCC) using GaN devices with thermal design is presented. A five-level prototype based on this HBCC is fabricated, which can provide 500W peak power and accurately track an envelope signal with bandwidth near to 400kHz.

AB Renewable energy sources have been increasingly adopted to reduce greenhouse emissions. However, they are normally interfaced with power grids through grid-connected power converters without any inertia contribution. This will lead to the decreased power system inertia. As a solution, the method of inertia emulation by power converters has been reported to handle this problem. However, the DC-link capacitors of power converters cannot restore their voltages after injecting the power required by inertia emulation. Thus, if the load change causes another DC-link voltage drop, the undesirable overmodulation may appear. Moreover, power converters cannot provide multiple inertia support during cascading frequency events without the DC-link voltage recovery. To address the above concerns, this paper proposes an autonomous DC-link voltage restoration method that allows the restoration of DC-link voltages after individual frequency events. Simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

In this paper, we present a newly developed super-resolution restoration system, called MAGiGAN, based on our original GPT-SRR system combined with deep learning image networks to be able to restore up to 4x higher resolution enhancement using multi-angle repeat images as input.

ID REGULARIZATION
AB Image restoration is a necessary stage in the processing of remotely sensed hyperspectral images, when they are severely degraded by blur and noise. We address the semi-blind restoration of such degraded images component-wise, according to a sequential scheme. By semi-blind, we mean introducing a minimum of a priori knowledge on main unknowns in the restoration process. For each degraded component image, main unknowns are the point spread function of the blur, the original component image and the noise level. Then, the sequential component-wise scheme amounts in a first stage to estimating the blur point spread function directly from the considered degraded component image and in a second and final stage, deconvolving the degraded channel by using the PSF previously estimated. Our contribution is to improve further the sequential component-wise semi-blind variants of a recently proposed method. In this work, modifications previously introduced separately are applied all together. All these modifications together are beneficial as they tend to make the newly proposed method as independent as possible of the data content and their degradations. The resulting method is experimentally compared against its original version and the best ADMM-based alternative found experimentally in previous works. The tests are performed on three real Specim-AISA-Eagle hyperspectral images. The component images of these images are degraded synthetically with eight real and arbitrary blurs. Our attention is mainly paid to the objective analysis of the l(1)-norm of the estimation errors. Experimental results of this comparative analysis show that the newly proposed method exhibits interesting competitive performances and can outperform the methods involved in the experimental comparison.

ID REGULARIZATION
AB The light field polarimetric-spectro imager can capture the polarization, spectral and intensity characteristics of targets in a single shot. Due to diffraction and misalignment of components, there is aliasing among the spectral and polarization channels. In order to obtain accurate spectra of targets, the inversion methods are needed to process the captured data. We study three inversion algorithms, including the Least Squares algorithm, the Truncated Generalized Singular Value Decomposition algorithm and the Tikhonov regulation algorithm. Firstly, we simulated the light field spectral-polarization data with different noise levels and reconstructed spectra using three methods. The result shows that the Tikhonov algorithm can reconstruct spectrum with better accuracy and has better robustness than the other two algorithms. The algorithms are also used to process the data captured by a prototype system. The results also show the superior of the Tikhonov algorithm.

   analysis; image processing methods; PSF
AB All optical imaging systems, which work in atmospheric turbulence, are influenced by refraction index fluctuations that often affect beam's utility. We present a comparison of four methods (Wiener Filter (WF), Regularized Filter (RF), Lucy-Richardson Method (LRM), Blind Deconvolution Method (BDM)), which are used to improve the quality of an image observed through horizontal-path atmospheric turbulence. We use simulation and real image acquisition in both weak and strong turbulence conditions to assess performance of chosen methods. Simulation is used to generate an image distorted along the horizontal optical path by convolution of turbulence-degraded point spread function (PSF) with original image, the result being restored by these four methods. Additionally, modified von Karman phase power spectrum density (PSD) is used for generation of phase screens to simulate weak and strong Kolmogorov turbulence, with different Fried parameters. Restoration results are compared by MTF (Modulation Transfer Function) on edges, and running time. It is shown that LRM produces the best image quality. For studying how the methods perform in real images, an experiment is carried out to capture the real images against varying turbulence strengths. These turbulence-induced images are restored by the same methods mentioned above. The experimental results are compared by the above criteria with modeling results, this demonstrates that LRM shows the best image quality, with highest MTF values and relatively short processing time.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the litterfall deposition, the decomposition rate (K-L) and the water holding capacity (WHC) of litter stored in the soil in two areas degraded by mining submitted to different methods of forest restoration: induction of natural regeneration (NR) and planting seedlings of native forest species (PS) with a forest fragment (FF) used as reference. The litterfall deposition was collected monthly over 12 months in collectors of 0.25 m(2). The KL was estimated by the relation between annual litter production and litter stock in the soil surface. WHC was determined in the rainy and dry period. The litterfall deposition was lower in PS with values of 6.61 +/- 0.20, 10.75 +/- 0.52 and 11.83 +/- 0.72 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1 )for PS, NR and FF respectively. The K-L and WHC were significantly lower in PS when compared to NR and FF, and WHC decreased significantly from the rainy season to the dry season. The induction of natural regeneration was the more effective restoration method for degraded areas regarding litterfall deposition, decomposition and water retention capacity, surpassing planting native tree species and approaching a native forest fragment.

AB Ciliwung River is the biggest river which flows across DKI Jakarta, where the river flows through the city, the settlements, and slums in Jakarta. Problems that occur in the Ciliwung River in Jakarta one of which is the quality of water. This research using some datas, there are secondary and primary data like river dimension and visualization of water quality of Ciliwung River. This research using a descriptive method which describes the comparison between a physical and chemical parameter for the durationn of three (3) years post-restoration. The physical parameters used in this reasearch are temperature and TDS, the chemical parameters are pH dan DO. Based on the result of data analyzing, we get the temperature average parameter pre-restoration is 28.30 degrees C and TDS level is 151.96 mg/L, so the logical of standard quality criteria match with class 3. Post-restoration got the temperature 22.06 degrees C and TDS level 224.20mg/L, so that water quality criteria match with class 2. For the chemical parameters the average pH and DO values pre-restoration are 6.84 and 4mg/L, respectively which match with class 2 category. Post-restoration, the chemical parameter about pH level is 7.41 and DO 8.4 mg/L, so the standard quality criteria match with class 1.

AB This paper examines recent developments of service restoration in distribution systems (DS). Recent approaches and challenges for service restoration are compared and analyzed. Service restoration is a multi-constraint, multi-objective, combinatorial, non-linear optimization problem. Its main aim is to maximize the number of priority loads restored, while minimizing the number of switching operations, within the shortest time interval. This paper introduces Hybrid Multi-Agent System Approach for service restoration, which uses Distributed Generators (DG) and Electric Vehicles (EVs). EVs are basically batteries, which are charged at low-load conditions and transmit required amount of energy at peak-load conditions back to the grid. Before applying this system in real cases, optimal positions of DGs must be found. In order to do so OpenDSS Distribution network simulator was used for IEEE 123 and 30 Bus System. After that, R&M algorithm was developed and implemented under IEEE 30 Bus System. The main goal of this algorithm is to determine the most optimal island ranges according to the given objective functions and constraints. Proposed R&M algorithm demonstrated quite promising results as it fulfill all preset requirements.

AB The digital image processing has got much attention of the researchers towards development of automatic optical character recognition system. The document image analysis mainly focused on printed and handwritten document images. In printed document image analysis, the input image is that of machine printed document, where as in handwritten document image analysis, it is of document, handwritten by different persons on a paper by using pen or pencil. Presently, most of the research work addresses issues related to handwritten document images and the Kannada script. The printed script recognition system is much easier than handwritten script recognition system. In printed documents, font style and size of the characters are standardized, where as handwritten characters vary in size and style of font from person to person and time to time, which is a very tedious job for recognition. In this paper, a new novel approach is proposed for restoration of degraded historical Kannada handwritten documents using the combination of special local and global binarization techniques, by eliminating of non-uniformly illuminated background. The performance evaluation is done by extracting geometric feature values of Pricision, Recall, F-Measure, MSE and PSNR and these results are compared with manual results obtained by the Epigraphists. It is also compared with other standard methods, namely, souvola and niblack in the literature, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Restoration of degraded historical Kannada handwritten documents plays an important role in age identification, Kannada character recognition and classification for the Kannada handwritten documents.

AB The majority of studies on the ecological success of river restoration show improved morphological conditions, but a poor response of the biota. Because most river restoration projects are costly, a debate has started on the meaningfulness of such investments. Yet only a few studies have investigated the societal dimension of river restoration projects in detail. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to shed light on the social aspects of river restoration. Our empirical study consisted of two parts: (1) an explorative study conducted with 32 residents encountered at three restored river sections in Germany and (2) standardized telephone interviews with 760 residents living in the vicinity of 10 different restored river sections in three federal states. The survey covered questions including which activities local residents carry out at restored river sections, how they judge the nature experience, and how they perceive (negative) effects and costs. The restored river sections are perceived positively by > 80% of the respondents describing the respective section as near-natural and beautiful. In the view of the survey participants, both the ecosystem and residents profit highly from the restoration measure (> 90%), while the agricultural sector is not rated as a high profiteer (36%, multiple answers were possible). In full awareness of the costs of restoration projects (approximately 400,000 Euros per river km), 70% of the interviewees regard further restoration projects as useful and only 6% as not useful. The results show that river restorations are of great value and are held in high esteem by the population. Moreover, the interviewees considered the investments made by the public or sponsors to be predominantly useful. These results are highly valuable for water managers and politicians as the societal relevance of river restoration might be a key factor in the ongoing public and political discussion about river restoration.

AB It is often a challenge to predict the impact of ecosystem restoration because many critical relationships and feedbacks between natural and human systems are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce a novel framework to characterize restoration dynamics within coupled human-natural systems. Because dynamics surrounding restoration are complex, we investigate the potential for sense of place, i.e., emotional attachment to place, to elucidate relationships between human and natural systems during times of change, such as restoration. Integrating sense of place with ecological metrics, a typology of restoration scenarios that exemplify complex relationships between social and ecological drivers emerges. We propose an identify-visualize-create framework for parsing restoration objectives and curating sense of place around the functional ecosystem state. Achieving coupled human-natural objectives thus requires evaluation of baseline sense of place early in the restoration process and active pursuit of opportunities that build stakeholder attachment over the long term.

AB We focus on a large and sustained stakeholder process for river restoration related to hydropower production that failed to reach any significant natural resource management outcomes. We explore to what extent the stakeholder process can be characterized as a learning-based intervention as well as the reasons for the lack of outcomes. The analysis draws on insights from existing literature of procedural and institutional factors identified to foster and hinder social learning in stakeholder processes. The analysis finds that the stakeholder process featured virtually all fostering procedural factors as well as various fostering institutional factors identified in the literature. The main hindering institutional element consisted of strong pre-existing water rights, granted by the legislation governing hydropower production and river restoration in Sweden. Existing legislation provided a key stakeholder with the power to successfully reach its objective through the unilateral action of exiting the stakeholder process. Our results demonstrate that various learning outcomes, including knowledge acquisition, trust building, and the creation of networks are possible in stakeholder processes that feature power imbalances. The results also suggest that, ultimately, the power imbalance limited the process from reaching significant natural resource management outcomes, both in the short and longer terms. Based on comparison with international cases, the results reveal the need to focus attention on the national scale to remediate power imbalances in stakeholder processes that arise from a share of stakeholders possessing strong prior rights to the use of natural resources. In such cases, sustainable management of natural resources could be better served by efforts to modify existing legislation, rather than investments in resource-intensive learning-based interventions.

AB In this study, the recreational value of restoring corals reefs was estimated in the context of a site in Northwestern Philippines. This study applied the travel cost method with a variation that integrates a contingent behavior question. This allowed for the estimation of marginal benefits in the context of a change in recreational asset quality. The recreational study site, including the reef in its damaged state, gave rise to average per visit benefits of around US$63.00. With a restored reef that average value increased to approximately US$113.00 per visit. Hence, the average marginal benefits associated with an investment in reef restoration for this case study site is in the order of US$50 per visit, with a 95% confidence interval of US$0.72 million to US$$3.34 M yr(1).

AB In this paper, we propose a method that use the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as a plug-and-play prior for image restoration in sensor network. The "plug-and-play" concept as an image prior is extended to image restoration and just mentioned in recent years. Particularly, the plug-and-play alternating direction method of the multiplier is very fit for the GMM framework to regularize the sub-problems. In order to avoid error results caused by general minimum of mean square error criterion, we propose two spatial constraints: one applies the K-nearest-neighbor method based on an Euclidean distance to measure the similarity of image patches in clustering step; the other adopts the Gaussian weight based on the Mahalanobis distance to update the mean vector and covariance matrix. Finally, we compare our method with several recent state-of-the-art methods, and the results show that our proposed method has good performance in preserving details and eliminating the staircase effect.

TI The Experience of Restoration from a transatlantic Perspective: a
   comparative Study of Political Survival in the United Kingdom of the
   Netherlands and in the New Kingdom of Granada (1810-1820)
SO REVISTA UNIVERSITARIA DE HISTORIA MILITAR
DE Restoration; Revolution; Netherlands; New Kingdom of Granada; political
   survival
AB In the present article, two historians compare the results of their respective researches to demonstrate the convenience of integrating the colonial perspective to the study of the early nineteenth century Restoration era. In order to do so, they adopt an unprecedented comparative approach which confronts the experiences lived during that period by an European kingdom with the difficulties that a Spanish American kingdom faced in the same period. The text also focuses on the strategies adopted by revolutionary leaders in the Netherlands and the New Kingdom of Granada in order to preserve their lives and influence after the return, respectively, of William I and Ferdinand VII. The central idea is to comprehensibly analyse the "politics of forgetting" and question whether the restored monarchies' capability of integrating influential, reluctant subjects determined their subsequent failure or success. As it shall be shown, unlike in Europe, Spanish American Restorations were of very limited duration and, as opposed to the former-which usually tended to maintain the most relevant institutional transformations derived from the revolution and the Napoleonic regimes-, intended to erase the legacy of the insurgent governments. In addition, whereas European Restorations promoted the integration of the new society that emerged from the political clash with the Ancient Regime's elite, in the Spanish overseas territories the aim was to purge offices of all those who were previously committed to the rebellion. In order to understand these differences regarding both duration and social orientation, the present article underlines the importance of considering previous revolutionary experiences where the political transformation process had more time to take roots and Restoration was moderated and willing to assimilate the revolutionary legacy. On the other side of the spectrum, in the Spanish American case -and also in Spain-, a period of swift political changes, independently of their transcendence, triggered intransigent and violent Restorations.

TI "Seduced indians"? Political and military participations of mapuche
   during the Restoration of Fernando VII, Chile, 1814-1825
SO REVISTA UNIVERSITARIA DE HISTORIA MILITAR
DE Restoration; Ferdinand VII; Mapuche; Biobio River; Araucania
AB This article analyses the military and political participation of the Mapuche people during the early years of Ferdinand VII's second reign, mainly between 1814-1825. It is part of a larger scholarly discussion about the causes and consequences of the Restoration of the monarchy in Chile, focusing on the interventions of various Mapuche territorial units at the south of the Biobio River. The central hypothesis presented here is that the Mapuche strategy of shifting alliances explains the relatively long duration of the war in Chile -and, therefore, of the Restoration- when compared with other areas of South America where disputes with the royalists were largely settled by the end of the 1810s. The sources indicate that during the so-called "War to the Death", Araucania underwent a complex process of negotiation between the main Mapuche caciques and regular military officers. In accord with the latest historiographical contributions to this debate, this paper concludes that Mapuche leaders participated actively and strategically in the negotiations. In other words: they had a sophisticated political agency and were not simply conditioned by royalist and/or revolutionary authorities. This article is divided into four sections. The first section focuses on the 1793-1810 period and outlines the state of the relations between Mapuche communities and Spanish colonial authorities in the build-up to the first proclamation of independence. The second section tackles the Mapuche participation in the war that ravaged the Central Valley within the broader context of Ferdinand VII's restoration. The following section discusses the negotiation mechanisms both between Mapuche leaders and royalist and between Mapuche leaders and revolutionary factions during 1817-1823. It was during the "War to the Death" that the internal divisions within Mapuche society became exposed, with some leaders and their communities supporting the royalists and others the revolutionaries; supporting, in some cases, both sides at the same time or shifting their allegiances from one side to another as the conflict played out. Then, the epilogue provides further evidence of this flexibility as it analyses the Treaty of Tapihue of 1825 which, under the government of Ramon Freire, brought the guerrilla war in southern Chile to an end. This treaty, signed at Tapihue, offers us a clear insight into the problems derived from the early organisation of the independent Chilean Republic, as well as the fluctuating, pragmatic ways in which the Mapuche people dealt with the new political reality.

TI The Shadow of Restoration. Military Threats and Political Turns during
   the Revolution in Rio de la Plata, 1814-1815
SO REVISTA UNIVERSITARIA DE HISTORIA MILITAR
DE revolution; monarchical restoration; war; diplomacy; Rio de la Plata
AB Of all the major revolutionary strongholds in Spanish America, Rio de la Plata was curiously the only one to never fall back into royalist hands. This rioplatense exceptionality resulted in local historiography paying little attention to the, however, highly transcendental consequences of victorious monarchical restoration from 1814 onward. Starting with an analysis of the counterrevolutionary trends present in the Rio de la Plata region since the outbreak of the revolution and their alleged weaknesses, this paper evaluates how the threat of military expeditions and the adverse international context conditioned the conservative -and to a great extent, monarchical- turn of the main local political leaders at the beginning of the second half of the revolutionary decade. This article pays particular attention to the 1814-1815 period in Rio de la Plata -a political moment haunted by the ultimo Lay averted threat of General Morillos's Expedition- in order to reinterpret the positions of a number of political actors facing an imminent invasion, and demonstrate that, even though revolutionaries were confident in their military strength, they greatly feared the possibility of one of the revolutionary factions realigning with the King. In this sense, the revolutionary parties presented the peninsular expedition as an opportunity to overcome the division between two concurrent leaderships: that of the Buenos Aires-based Directory and that of the Banda Oriental led by Jose Artigas. We shall demonstrate, however, how Morillo's detour to Venezuela reignited tensions among revolutionaries, and how the Portuguese invasion of the Banda Oriental, with Buenos Aires' consent, could in fact be interpreted as a local variation of the monarchical Restoration. Based on diplomatic correspondence between Portenos, Orientales, Portuguese and Spanish agents, this paper combines thus the contributions of the new political history with those of the social history of war.

SO REVISTA UNIVERSITARIA DE HISTORIA MILITAR
DE New Granada; Reconquista; Restoration; Monarchy; Tunja
AB This article studies the post-revolutionary period (1816-1819) in Tunja, one of New Granada's provinces. First of all, it shows the main features of the revolutionary event within this jurisdiction, a social disruption that the pacifying enterprise sought to erase. Secondly, the article analyzes how the royalist authorities governed and the difficulties that they struggled with in order to bring the promised calm to the province's society. And thirdly, it examines the practices of resistance, which were developed against the restoration project. The present article seeks to contribute to the filling of the existing vacuum in the study of this period at the provincial level. Besides, it aims to contribute to the understanding of how the royalist authorities tried to govern, the difficulties that emerged and how the Neo-Granadian Revolution had transformed provincial society and how this added further difficulties to the stabilization of the jurisdiction. In this sense, this paper takes part in the reflection about the most appropriate way to denominate this period, which patriotic historiography expeditiously managed to characterize exclusively by the violence and the usurpations of the forces sent by Ferdinand VII. As several authors have already shown, this representation has important limitations insofar as it ignores not-so-battered regions, the military and civil leaders who acted with moderation and the important social support behind the "pacifying project". The need to incorporate these elements into the narrative about this historical period is no obstacle to continue to define it as a "Reconquista". All the more so given that it was an intrinsically conflictive enterprise, which for many years was opposed by a set of opponents who had been claiming themselves in a legitimate and materially effective way as a political group outside the Spanish monarchy. In the elaboration of this text, I used a great variety of documents from regional archives, the press and documentary compilations in Colombia and Spain which incorporate the voices of the participants in these events.

SO REVISTA UNIVERSITARIA DE HISTORIA MILITAR
DE Independence of Mexico; absolutist restoration; militarization; Cadiz
   Constitution; counterinsurgency
AB This article deals with a set of historical phenomena located in New Spain during the period of the absolutist restoration. The text is aimed to expose the complex-ity of the events that occurred between the arrival of the news of the restoration of Ferdinand VII as an absolute monarch in 1814 and the new implementation of the constitutional regime in 1820. Among other objectives, the present study aims to analyze the impact of the return to the Ancien Regime envisioned by Ferdinand VII in terms of the political and military structure. To this end, we will first consider the particularities of the New Spain restoration and the vicissitudes of the conflict in those years. In this way, the article reviews the decline and fragmentation of the insurgency after the fall of its most visible leader, priest Jose Maria Morelos, and problematizes the arbitrariness and ambiguities caused by the abolition of the constitutional regime and the political, military and financial implications that produced the absolutist restoration ordered by the viceroy Felix Maria Calleja. In second instance, the significant Oaxacan case is examined as one of the few but significant examples of genuine military reconquest followed by the problematic and relative abolition of Cadiz constitutionalism, a scenario that offers interesting cases of political opportunism and manipulations tending aiming at the segregation of groups and entire communities. Finally, the present article examines three emblematic problems of the period in question, which are re-viewed to evaluate the policies of the war: the implementation of the pardons as one of the most representative phenomena of continuity between the viceroys Calleja and his successor Juan Ruiz de Apodaca; the militarism of provincial governments and territorial control structures as tangible consequences of the prolongation of the independence revolution and the growth of the "realistas" militias, the latter as a visible example of the increasing militarization of New Spain's society.

First of all, extract the patch groups by utilize the non-local similar patches, and then using the simultaneous sparse coding to develop a non-local extension of Gaussian scale mixture model. Finally integrate the patch group model and Gaussian scale mixture model into encoding framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves leading performance in terms of both quantitative measures and visual quality. In addition, our algorithm generates high-resolution images that are competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other similar methods.

AB Co-occurrence pattern is a good indicator of environmental changes, being a consequence of human industrial activity. A good model of co-occurrence mechanisms is the degree of species ordering in the assemblage, which indicates the existence of interspecific interactions such as competition for available resources. The aim of the study was to assess the co-occurrence of ground beetles as a parameter evaluating the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration processes in postindustrial areas. In addition, the distribution of the beetles' body size pattern in the environmental types was assessed. Responses of carabid co-occurrence patterns to restoration practice in three types of environments: recultivated, spontaneously regenerated and reference forest were investigated. C-score index as a coefficient of co-occurrence, and Lorenz curves, skewness and kurtosis coefficients of body size distribution reflected the succession stage. The carabid assemblages from the references and spontaneously restoring sites showed a significant segregation pattern. Community disassembly occurred only among assemblages of recultivated sites. The body size distribution of Carabidae in recultivated areas indicated the lowest share of large, forest species characteristics of stable ecological systems. The results emphasize the usefulness of the co-occurrence index for the evaluation of the effectiveness of restoration treatments in post-industrial areas.

AB The physical and hydrological properties of peat from seven peatlands in northern Maputaland (South Africa) were investigated and related to the degradation processes of peatlands in different hydrogeomorphic settings. The selected peatlands are representative of typical hydrogeomorphic settings and different stages of human modification from natural to severely degraded. Nineteen transects (141 soil corings in total) were examined in order to describe peat properties typical of the distinct hydrogeomorphic settings. We studied degree of decomposition, organic matter content, bulk density, water retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity and hydrophobicity of the peats. From these properties we derived pore size distribution, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and maximum capillary rise. We found that, after drainage, degradation advances faster in peatlands containing wood peat than in peatlands containing radicell peat. Eucalyptus plantations in catchment areas are especially threatening to peatlands in seeps, interdune depressions and unchannelled valley bottoms. All peatlands and their recharge areas require wise management, especially valley-bottom peatlands with swamp forest vegetation. Blocking drainage ditches is indispensable as a first step towards achieving the restoration of drained peatland areas, and further measures may be necessary to enhance the distribution of water. The sensitive swamp forest ecosystems should be given conservation priority.

AB Aim: A large variety of dental materials are available for the production of implant-supported fixed restorations. Materials with different properties are likely to behave differently during clinical function, which may result in different prevalence and types of complications. The aim of the present review was to summarise, analyse and discuss the prevalence and types of complications or failures related to dental materials in implant-supported restorations.
   Materials and methods: A strategy was set up using the PICO format and the search was performed using the PubMed database, including a hand search of reference lists. Two independent reviewers selected papers based on a set of criteria. The number of events of complications was summarised.
   Results: The initial search produced 2764 titles. After application of criteria, 47 publications were selected for analysis. Seventeen studies reported on 1447 single crowns and 30 studies reported on 2190 fixed dental prostheses. The most common complications were fracture or chipping of the veneer material, loss of retention and lost access hole fillings. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, and large variation in number of restorations per material group, no conclusive correlation between type of material and type of technical complication and/or failure could be established.
   Conclusions: The review did not succeed in providing convincing evidence to answer the question concerning a possible relationship between restoration materials and prevalence of technical complications in implant-supported restorations.

In fact, the project addressed all the various themes of restoration, and not merely those specifically tied to the field of archaeology (excavation, consolidation, integration or replacement of missing portions), but also architectural considerations, such as stratifications and the surrounding environment. In the work of integration and consolidation, traditional techniques were used, employing the same materials as in ancient times, along with modern-day ones (reinforced concrete and steel), evaluating each situation as it arose, with the most effective solution determined through direct experimentation in the field.

Restorations undertaken in the twentieth century allowed to preserve it, but the deterioration of some materials used in them, produced 75 years later, the release of stone fragments with risk of accident and irrecoverable losses in their valuable carvings and historical patinas. Last restoration (2016-2017) has analyzed the materials and techniques with which it was built and with which it was restored in the historical intervention of the early twentieth century. From this, the facade has been restored again, to guarantee the conservation of its different types of stone and patinas that, while still preserved in some protected areas, improve the understanding of the character of this fundamental work of Spaniard Plateresque architecture.

AB The Cruz de Cerrajeria is a wrought-iron cross forged in 1692 by the master locksmith Sebastian Conde. Its exposure to environmental elements, its structural characteristics and the inappropriate application of superimposed coats of paint have given rise to severe degradation due to corrosion. By means of instrumental analysis techniques, we were able to accurately identify the causes of the deterioration, determine the characteristics of the metal and evaluate its response to the application of passivation and stabilization treatments. Through an experimental approach we were able to determine the most appropriate solutions regarding the restoration and protection measures adopted to combat corrosion, considering the application possibilities according to the typology and shape of the numerous pieces that form the Cruz de Cerrajeria. The treatment studied here guarantees the adequate protection of the cross, water evacuation and prevents galvanic couples.

DE Hyperspectral image (HSI); restoration; nonconvex sparsity measure;
   robust principal component analysis (RPCA)
AB Recently, robust principal component analysis (RPCA) based methods have been used for hyperspectral images (HSIs) restoration to simultaneously remove several types of noise, including Gaussian noise, impulse noise, stripes, and so on. However, most of these RPCA methods formulate the optimization problem with a convex l(1)-norm penalty, which over-penalizes large entries of vectors, and results in a biased solution. In this paper, a novel nonconvex sparsity regularizer (NonSR) for measuring the clean HSI low rank structure and noise sparsity structure is proposed, which can effectively approximate rank function and noise sparsity instead of the convex l(1)-norm. By embedding the sparsity regularizer into the RPCA framework, we formulate a new model, which enhance the capability in simultaneously removing several types of noise. In addition, an iterative algorithm based on the alternative direction multiplier method (ADMM) is developed to effectively solve the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NonSR method outperforms state-of-the-art HSIs restoration techniques.

AB The technology of on-ground data processing from the Russian EO systems allowing geocoding images of the Earth's surface with a specified accuracy in case of an abnormal mode of the satellite measuring systems is considered. This technology is based on two-stage refinement of the rigorous model of the image geocoding using the coordinates of characteristic objects recognized on the analyzed and reference images. At the first stage, significant errors in the geolocation using the reference image of the Earth's surface obtained from the Landsat-8 satellite images are eliminated. At the second stage, the parameters of survey model are refined using the coordinates of individual reference objects geocoded with an accuracy of 5-10 m. The features of building of the reference information databank are considered. The algorithm SURF implemented on GPU is proposed to use for rapid and reliable identification of the same name objects at the first stage of the model refinement. The filtering of falsely identified of the same objects is carried out using statistical analysis. The examples of practical implementation of the developed technology for processing of the data from the satellites Kanopus-V and Resurs-P are presented.

AB Hyperspectral images acquired by remote sensing systems are generally degraded by noise and can be sometimes more severely degraded by blur. In this study, we address the semi-blind restoration of the degraded images component-wise, according to a sequential scheme. We propose a new component-wise semi-blind method for estimating effectively and accurately both the blur and the corresponding latent image. To prove applicability and higher efficiency of the proposed method, we compare it against the method it originates from. Our attention is mainly paid to the objective analysis (via l(1)-norm) of the estimation error accuracy. The tests are performed on a synthetic hyperspectral image. This image has been successively degraded with eight real blurs taken from the literature, each of a different support size. Conclusions, practical recommendations and perspectives are drawn from the results experimentally obtained.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image despeckling is still an open issue. Several approaches have been proposed in the last decades. The recently proposed Non Local approaches are often considered as the state of art of SAR despeckling. The difference between the NL algorithms presented in literature is mainly related to the adopted distance metric between patches and on the rule used for averaging the selected pixels. Within this manuscript a new metric for selecting similar patches is presented. The metric is based on the statistical distribution of the complex noisy image. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is adopted to compare the statistical distribution and to select similar patches. The approach has been tested and validate on real data, showing interesting performances.
