TI  - Ecosystem services changes between 2000 and 2015 in the Loess Plateau, China: A
      response to ecological restoration.

AB  - The Loess Plateau of China is one of the most severe soil and water loss areas in
      the world. Since 1999, the Grain to Green Program (GTGP) has been implemented in 
      the region. This study aimed to analyze spatial and temporal variations of
      ecosystem services from 2000 to 2015 to assess the effects of the GTGP, including
      carbon sequestration, water regulation, soil conservation and sand fixation.
      During the study period, the area of forest land and grassland significantly
      expanded, while the area of farmland decreased sharply. Ecosystem services showed
      an overall improvement with localized deterioration. Carbon sequestration, water 
      regulation and soil conservation increased substantially. Sand fixation showed a 
      decreasing trend mainly because of decreased wind speeds. There were synergies
      between carbon sequestration and water regulation, and tradeoffs between soil
      conservation and sand fixation. It was concluded that ecological projects have
      contributed significantly to the rehabilitation of the fragile ecosystems of this
      region. To make these projects more successful and sustainable, long-term
      management procedures are necessary to maintain and consolidate the improvements.

TI  - Seasonal Changes and Vertical Distribution of Fine Root Biomass During Vegetation
      Restoration in a Karst Area, Southwest China.
PG  - 2001
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2018.02001 [doi]
AB  - In karst ecosystems, plants absorbing smaller amounts of nutrients, owing to
      shallow soil, show limited growth. In addition, fine roots (diameter < 2 mm)
      contribute to the regulation of nutrient cycles in terrestrial ecosystems.
      However, the spatial and temporal variations of fine root biomass in different
      vegetation types of the karst region remains poorly understood. In this study, we
      investigated the seasonal and vertical variation in biomass, necromass, and total
      mass of fine roots using sequential soil coring under different stages of
      vegetation restoration (grassland, shrubland, secondary forest, and primary
      forest) in Southwest China. The results showed that the fine root biomass and
      necromass ranged from 136.99 to 216.18 g m(-2) and 47.34 to 86.94 g m(-2),
      respectively. The total mass of fine roots and their production ranged from
      187.00 to 303.11 g m(-2) and 55.74 to 100.84 g m(-2) year(-1), respectively. They
      showed a single peak across the vegetation restoration gradient. The fine root
      biomass and total fine root mass also showed a single peak with seasonal change. 
      In autumn, the fine root biomass was high, whereas the necromass was low. Most of
      the fine roots were concentrated in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm), which
      accounted more than 57% root biomass, and decreased with increasing soil depth.
      In addition, fine root production showed a similar vertical pattern of variation 
      with biomass. Overall, our results suggested that fine roots show clear seasonal 
      and vertical changes with vegetation succession. Moreover, there was a higher
      seasonal fluctuation and a greater vertical decreasing trend in late-successional
      stages than in the early-successional stages. The conversion of degraded land to 
      forest could improve the productivity of underground ecosystems and vegetation
      restoration projects in the fragile karst region should, therefore, continue.

TI  - Total Knee Arthroplasty in Patients With Extra-Articular Deformity: Restoration
      of Mechanical Alignment Using Accelerometer-Based Navigation System.
LID - S0883-5403(19)30006-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.arth.2018.12.042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with post-traumatic
      extra-articular deformity (EAD) is difficult to manage using conventional
      instrumentation techniques. In this study, we evaluate whether accelerometer
      navigation system can be a valuable option to make accurate bone resections and
      restore the neutral mechanical axis in complex TKA patients with EAD. METHODS:
      From May 2015 to June 2017, 18 consecutive TKA were performed in 18 patients with
      knee osteoarthritis with associated EAD. An accelerometer-based navigation system
      was used to guide tibial and femoral resection in the coronal and sagittal plane.
      Postoperative lower limb alignment in coronal plane and component position in
      coronal and sagittal plane was measured through full-leg weight-bearing X-ray.
      Clinical score were recorded using the Knee Society Score at the final follow-up.
      RESULTS: The mean hip-knee-ankle angle was 0.9 degrees +/- 1.4 degrees varus
      alignment. The coronal alignment of the femoral component was 89.2 degrees +/-
      1.9 degrees , and the coronal alignment of the tibial component was 89.4 degrees 
      +/- 2.1 degrees . The sagittal alignment of the femoral component was 93.2
      degrees +/- 1.9 degrees , and the sagittal alignment of the tibial component was 
      84.4 degrees +/- 3.1 degrees . At the final follow-up, the Knee Society Score was
      89 points (range, 82-100), and the functional score was 86.7 points (range,
      60-100). No intraoperative and postoperative surgical complications were reported
      using this technology. CONCLUSION: Accelerometer-based navigation is accurate in 
      achieving neutral mechanical alignment and optimal implant position after TKA in 
      patients with EAD. This system should be considered a valuable option to the more
      complex technique of computer navigation or robotic surgery.

      suitability index for oyster restoration.

AB  - Geospatial habitat suitability index (HSI) models have emerged as powerful tools 
      that integrate pertinent spatial information to guide habitat restoration
      efforts, but have rarely accounted for spatial variation in ecosystem service
      provision. In this study, we utilized satellite-derived chlorophyll a
      concentrations for Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA in conjunction with data on
      water flow velocities and dissolved oxygen concentrations to identify potential
      restoration locations that would maximize the oyster reef-associated ecosystem
      service of water filtration. We integrated these novel factors associated with
      oyster water filtration ecosystem services within an existing, 'Metapopulation
      Persistence' focused GIS-based, HSI model containing biophysical (e.g., salinity,
      oyster larval connectivity) and logistical (e.g., distance to nearest restoration
      material stockpile site) factors to identify suitable locations for oyster
      restoration that maximize long-term persistence of restored oyster populations
      and water filtration ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, we compared the
      'Water Filtration' optimized HSI with the HSI optimized for 'Metapopulation
      Persistence,' as well as a hybrid model that optimized for both water filtration 
      and metapopulation persistence. Optimal restoration locations (i.e., locations
      corresponding to the top 1% of suitability scores) were identified that were
      consistent among the three HSI scenarios (i.e., "win-win" locations), as well as 
      optimal locations unique to a given HSI scenario (i.e., "tradeoff" locations).
      The modeling framework utilized in this study can provide guidance to restoration
      practitioners to maximize the cost-efficiency and ecosystem services value of
      habitat restoration efforts. Furthermore, the functional relationships between
      oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentrations, water flow velocities, 
      and dissolved oxygen applied in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of
      hypotheses related to optimal conditions for oyster reef restoration to maximize 
      water quality enhancement benefits.

      ecosystems.
PG  - e01858
LID - 10.1002/eap.1858 [doi]
AB  - Tractable practices for soil microbial restoration in tallgrass prairies
      reclaimed from agriculture are a critical gap in traditional ecological
      restoration. Long-term fertilization and tilling permanently alter soil bacterial
      and fungal communities, requiring microbe-targeted restoration methods to improve
      belowground ecosystem services and carbon storage in newly restored prairies.
      These techniques are particularly important when restoring for climate-ready
      ecosystems, adapted to altered temperature regimes. To approach these issues, we 
      conducted a multifactorial greenhouse experiment to test the effects of plant
      species richness, soil amendment and elevated temperature on soil microbial
      diversity, growth and function. Treatments consisted of three seedlings of one
      plant species (A. gerardii) or one seedling each of three plant species (A.
      gerardii, E. pallida, C. lanceolata). Soil amendments included cellulose
      addition, inoculation with a microbial community collected from an undisturbed
      remnant prairie, and a control. We assessed microbial communities using
      extracellular enzyme assays, Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, 
      predicted bacterial metabolic pathways from sequence data and phospholipid fatty 
      acid analysis (PLFA), which includes both bacterial and fungal lipid abundances. 
      Our results indicate that addition of cellulose selects for slow-growing
      bacterial taxa (Verrucomicrobia) and fungi at ambient temperature. However, at
      elevated temperature, selection for slow-growing bacterial taxa is enhanced,
      while selection for fungi is lost, indicating temperature sensitivity among
      fungi. Cellulose addition was a more effective means of altering soil community
      composition than addition of microbial communities harvested from a remnant
      prairie. Soil water content was typically higher in the A. gerardii treatment
      alone, regardless of temperature, but at ambient temperature only, predicted
      metagenomics pathways for bacterial carbon metabolism were more abundant with A. 
      gerardii. In summary, these results from a mesocosm test-case indicate that
      adding cellulose to newly restored soil and increasing the abundance of C4
      grasses, such as A. gerardii, can select for microbial communities adapted for
      slow growth and carbon storage. Further testing is required to determine if these
      approaches yield the same results in a field-level experiment. This article is

      Implications for restoration management of natural populations and cultivated
      varieties in the southwestern United States.
PG  - 482-499
LID - 10.1002/ece3.4767 [doi]
AB  - With the increasing frequency of large-scale restoration efforts, the need to
      understand the adaptive genetic structure of natural plant populations and their 
      relation to heavily utilized cultivars is critical. Bouteloua gracilis (blue
      grama) is a wind-dispersed, perennial grass consisting of several cytotypes (2n =
      2x-6x) with a widespread distribution in western North America. The species is
      locally dominant and used regularly in restoration treatments. Using amplified
      fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and cpDNA analyses, we assessed the genetic
      variability and adaptive genetic structure of blue grama within and among 44
      sampling sites that are representative of the species' environmental and habitat 
      diversity in the southwestern United States. Five cultivars were also included to
      investigate genetic diversity and differentiation in natural versus cultivated
      populations. Three main findings resulted from this study: (a) Ninety-four
      polymorphic AFLP markers distinguished two population clusters defined largely by
      samples on and off the Colorado Plateau; (b) substructure of samples on the
      Colorado Plateau was indicated by genetic divergence between boundary and
      interior regions, and was supported by cytotype distribution and cpDNA analysis; 
      and (c) six AFLP markers were identified as "outliers," consistent with being
      under selection. These loci were significantly correlated to mean annual
      temperature, mean annual precipitation, precipitation of driest quarter, and
      precipitation of wettest quarter in natural populations, but not in cultivated
      samples. Marker x environment relationships were found to be largely influenced
      by cytotype and cultivar development. Our results demonstrate that blue grama is 
      genetically variable, and exhibits genetic structure, which is shaped, in part,
      by environmental variability across the Colorado Plateau. Information from our
      study can be used to guide the selection of seed source populations for
      commercial development and long-term conservation management of B. gracilis,
      which could include genetic assessments of diversity and the adaptive potential
      of both natural and cultivated populations for wildland restoration.

      tendon restoration techniques.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the biomechanical comparison of
      channel-assisted minimally invasive restoration and three common Achilles tendon 
      restoration techniques in an in vitro model via a progressive rehabilitation
      program. The 42 porcine tendons were randomly assigned to the following six
      groups of tendons (n=7/group): Achillon, percutaneous Achilles repair system
      (PARS), Krackow, channel-assisted minimally invasive repair (CAMIR), CAMIR
      augmentation (CAMIR(+)), CAMIR-5 (repair with No. 5 Ethibond suture). There was
      no significant difference in elongation among groups following the first 10
      loading cycles, which consisted of 20-100 N at 1 Hz. The elongation of the CAMIR 
      group (7.51+/-1.77 mm) was significantly longer than the Achillon group
      (3.19+/-0.57 mm) and PARS group (3.73+/-0.66 mm; P<0.05) following 1,000 cycles. 
      However, the CAMIR group exhibited no significant difference vs. the Krackow
      (7.32+/-1.09 mm) and CAMIR(+) groups (7.11+/-1.50 mm) following 1,000 cycles.
      Following 2,000 cycles, there was no significant difference between the CAMIR-5
      (7.99+/-1.68 mm) group, and the Achillon (3.19+/-0.57 mm) and PARS groups
      (3.73+/-0.66 mm). At the point of restoration construct failure, the total cycles
      of the CAMIR group (median, 1,000; range, 1,000-1,000) were significantly less
      than the Achillon group (median, 2,000; range, 2,000-2,013) and PARS group
      (median, 2,000; range, 2,000-2,010; P<0.05), but had no significant difference
      compared with the Krackow group (median, 1,000; range, 1,000-1,000) and CAMIR(+) 
      group 1,000 (median, 1,000; range, 1,000-1,004). There was also no significant
      difference between the CAMIR-5 group (median, 2,000; range, 2,000-2,000), and the
      Achillon group (median, 2,000; range, 2,000-2,013) and PARS group (median, 2,000;
      range, 2,000-2,010). Restricted by the strength of suture, the one-suture CAMIR
      restoration technique was weaker than the three-suture Achillon and PARS
      restoration techniques, but there was no significant difference with the open
      Krackow restoration technique, which provides a reliable mechanical strength for 
      repairing. CAMIR has an advantage of reducing the risk of suture reactivity.

      Mitochondrial Function and Regulation of MAPK and AMPK/Akt/mTOR Signaling
      Pathway.

AB  - Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) extracted from Ganoderma lucidum (Leyss.
      ex Fr.) Karst, a traditional Chinese medicine, is a biologically active substance
      reported to possess anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and neurological protection. 
      However, it is unknown whether GLP have any protective effect against high-fat
      constituents-induced epithelial cell injury. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the protection and molecular mechanism of GLP on injury induced by
      palmitic acid (PA) in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2).
      First, we tested whether the treatment of GLP attenuate PA-induced IPEC-J2 cell
      death. GLP markedly blocked PA-caused cytotoxicity and apoptosis in IPEC-J2
      cells. Moreover, GLP recovered the decreased mitochondrial function and inhibited
      activation of caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, PA promoted
      cell apoptosis and autophagy through stimulation of phosphorylation of
      mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
      and inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR), which was reversed by GLP. Taken together, this study revealed a
      protective effect of GLP against PA-evoked IPEC-J2 cell death through
      anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic properties.

AB  - EU's Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 sets a 15% restoration target. However, the
      understanding of restoration as a management tool remains ambiguous at EU and
      Member State levels. As a country with rich biodiversity but low GDP, a
      well-defined priority setting approach is key for Bulgaria. The "Methodological
      framework for assessment and mapping of ecosystem condition and ecosystem
      services in Bulgaria" proposes a transition towards ecosystem management and
      monitoring of the Socio-Ecological System (SES), to be embedded in the
      environmental policy framework. We extend the analogy between SES and the human
      body's system in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a way to inform
      restoration priority setting and development of restoration and monitoring tools 
      at several levels: We apply the analogy and find that spatially explicit decision
      making on restoration, streamlined ecosystem monitoring and a number of other
      issues (green infrastructure, designation of protected areas, defragmentation and
      connectivity, cumulative impact assessment, etc.), are easier to understand,
      communicate, account for and manage. Ecosystem restoration is priority for China 
      and the country has accumulated research and practical experience, including
      study of links between ecosystem management and the historical principles of
      Chinese philosophy. The Bulgarian and European approach to ecosystem based
      management can benefit from analogies to TCM. We derive policy recommendations by
      analogy, and illustrate them on the example of Natural Capital Accounting.

TI  - Improved survival outcomes and restoration of graft-vs-leukemia effect by
      deferasirox after allogeneic stem cell transplantation in acute myeloid leukemia.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.1928 [doi]
AB  - Deferasirox is an oral iron-chelating agent having possible antileukemia and
      immune modulatory effects. Few reports have evaluated deferasirox in the setting 
      of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We
      investigated the impact of deferasirox after allo-HSCT in acute myeloid leukemia 
      (AML). Of 326 consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT in remission, analysis of
      198 patients not receiving deferasirox revealed the negative prognostic effect of
      hyperferritinemia (>/=1000 ng/mL) before and after allo-HSCT on survival mainly
      due to increase in relapse. Of 276 patients with hyperferritinemia at 1 month
      after allo-HSCT, 128 patients (46%) received deferasirox. Deferasirox induced a
      faster decline in serum ferritin level with a manageable safety profile, which
      significantly reduced relapse rather than nonrelapse mortality, resulting in
      better survival compared to patients not receiving deferasirox. Of note, the
      deferasirox group had a significantly higher incidence of chronic graft-vs-host
      disease, indicating improved graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effects evidenced by the
      presence of suppressed regulatory T cells and sustained higher proportion of NK
      cells in peripheral blood. This study firstly demonstrates the improved survival 
      and restoration of GVL effects of patients with AML by deferasirox, which also
      clarifies the detrimental effect of hyperferritinemia through after allo-HSCT.

      restoration.
LID - 10.1038/s41443-019-0115-1 [doi]
AB  - Our interim analysis of a phase II clinical trial on low-intensity extracorporeal
      shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT) for men with erectile dysfunction (ED) has
      demonstrated it is safe with no reported adverse outcomes. Interim analysis has
      demonstrated Sexual Encounter Profile 3 (ability to maintain erection till
      completion) was achieved in 60% of men prior to Li-ESWT, which increased to 90%
      after treatment. Nevertheless, limitations of our clinical trial include the lack
      of a sham arm and our inability to exclude men with psychogenic ED. We have begun
      recruitment of our phase III clinical trial that will allow assessment of
      treatment efficacy against a sham control arm. There exists substantial interest 
      in the use of restorative therapies (i.e., Li-ESWT, stem cells, and platelet rich
      plasma) for men with ED with the potential to combine therapies to potentially
      lead to an augmented response.

TI  - Sequential Gating Ensemble Network for Noise Robust Multiscale Face Restoration.
LID - 10.1109/TCYB.2018.2889791 [doi]
AB  - Face restoration from low resolution and noise is important for applications of
      face analysis recognition. However, most existing face restoration models omit
      the multiple scale issues in the face restoration problem, which is still not
      well solved in the research area. In this paper, we propose a sequential gating
      ensemble network (SGEN) for a multiscale noise robust face restoration issue. To 
      endow the network with multiscale representation ability, we first employ the
      principle of ensemble learning for SGEN network architecture design. The SGEN
      aggregates multilevel base-encoders and base-decoders into the network, which
      enables the network to contain multiple scales of receptive field. Instead of
      combining these base-en/decoders directly with nonsequential operations, the SGEN
      takes base-en/decoders from different levels as sequential data. Specifically, it
      is visualized that SGEN learns to sequentially extract high-level information
      from base-encoders in a bottom-up manner and restore low-level information from
      base-decoders in a top-down manner. Besides, we propose realizing bottom-up and
      top-down information combination and selection with a sequential gating unit
      (SGU). The SGU sequentially takes information from two different levels as inputs
      and decides the output based on one active input. Experimental results on the
      benchmark dataset demonstrate that our SGEN is more effective at multiscale human
      face restoration with more image details and less noise than state-of-the-art
      image restoration models. Further utilizing an adversarial training scheme, SGEN 
      also produces more visually preferred results than other models under subjective 
      evaluation.

TI  - Epidural Spinal Cord Stimulation facilitates immediate restoration of dormant
      motor and autonomic supraspinal pathways after chronic neurologically complete
      spinal cord injury.
LID - 10.1089/neu.2018.6006 [doi]
AB  - Epidural Spinal Cord Stimulation (eSCS) in combination with extensive
      rehabilitation has been reported to restore volitional movement in a select group
      of subjects after motor-complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Numerous questions
      about the generalizability of these findings to patients with longer term SCI
      have arisen, especially regarding the possibility of restoring autonomic
      function. To better understand the effect of eSCS on volitional movement and
      autonomic function, two female participants five and ten years after injury at
      ages 48 and 52 respectively with minimal spinal cord preservation on MRI were
      implanted with an eSCS system at the vertebral T12 level. We demonstrated that
      eSCS can immediately restore volitional movement in two female participants in
      their fifth and sixth decade of life with motor and sensory-complete SCI, five
      and ten years after sustaining severe radiographic injuries, and without
      prescribed or significant prehabilitation. Both patients experienced significant 
      improvements in surface EMG power during a volitional control task with eSCS on. 
      Cardiovascular function was also restored with eSCS in one participant with
      cardiovascular dysautonomia using specific eSCS settings during tilt challenge
      while not affecting function in a participant with normal cardiovascular
      function. Orgasm was achieved for the first time since injury in one participant 
      with and immediately following eSCS. Bowel-bladder synergy improved in both
      participants while restoring volitional urination in one with eSCS. While
      numerous questions remain, the ability to restore some supraspinal control over
      motor function below the level of injury, cardiovascular function, sexual
      function, and bowel and bladder function should promote intense efforts to
      investigate and develop optimization strategies to maximize recovery in all
      participants with chronic SCI.

AB  - Dissolved carbon (DC) is a critical component of the global carbon (C) cycle. DC 
      transport occurs through water-driven erosion and infiltration during rain
      storms. To explore the specific role of DC flux in topsoil C pool dynamics during
      rainfall events and predict the trend of ratios of lateral versus vertical DC
      efflux from topsoil in a vegetation restoration area, we measured the major DC
      fluxes at four runoff plots, during rainfall events in an eroding soil landscape 
      on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results show that topsoil vertical DC efflux
      into deep soil layers accounted for approximately 98.7 (+/-1.0) % of the total
      dissolved carbon efflux in plots with vegetation versus 95.3% in a plot without
      vegetation. The carbon sequestration capacity of the top soil would be
      underestimated by up to 38 (+/-5) % if the vertical DC efflux was omitted. The
      ratios of lateral versus vertical DC efflux tended to increase with rainfall
      intensity. The results of this study improve understanding of the carbon cycle
      processes during rainfall events in general and estimation of carbon
      sequestration rates in vegetation restoration regions such as the Chinese Loess
      Plateau in particular.

AB  - The impact of ghost fishing in large coastal ecosystems has generated
      considerable interest. In smaller, understudied systems with fewer stakeholders, 
      derelict fishing gear (DFGs) may have impacts similar to these larger systems at 
      the same relative scale. Four years of side scan sonar surveys in the Mullica
      River-Great Bay Estuary (New Jersey, USA) supported the recovery of 1776 DFGs
      off-season by commercial partners. Locations with high densities of recovered
      DFGs (>200DFGs/km(2)) occupied intersections of recreational vessel traffic and
      commercial crabbing activity. Condition and depth-in-sediment of recovered DFGs
      was used to evaluate true bycatch (terrapins, whelks, blue crabs) versus species 
      utilizing degraded gear as habitat (juvenile tautog, oyster toadfish).
      Critically, gear recovered in-season with low cost sonars (an additional 225
      DFGs) prevented the accumulation of new DFGs which likely generate the highest
      percentages of bycatch. Removal of DFGs in this system led to significant
      ecological (reduced bycatch), economic (>$61,000 in direct pay, reused gear), and
      anticipated future benefits (increased harvest).

AB  - The European oyster Ostrea edulis is a keystone species that is internationally
      recognised as 'threatened and declining' in the NE Atlantic by OSPAR and several 
      nations have consequently adopted strategies for its conservation and
      restoration. Understanding the settlement behaviour of O. edulis larvae is
      crucial to inform these strategies. We compared the efficiency of several
      treatments in triggering settlement. The most effective settlement occurred with 
      the presence of conspecifics: 100% settled in <23h. Marine stones with
      habitat-associated biofilms induced 81% settlement that started after a 45h
      delay. Sterile shells and terrestrial stones did not induce more settlement than 
      control treatments. These results indicate that O. edulis larvae are gregarious
      and finely-tuned to settle in response to cues which are indicative of their
      adult habitat requirements. The role of chemical cues in mediating settlement,
      and the importance of this to restoration, are discussed.

AB  - The Yangtze estuary is considered as an important eco-region of China, but it has
      been heavily disturbed by reclamation projects. We evaluated the effect of
      freshwater inflow on the self-restoration of macrobenthic diversity in 3-year-old
      vegetated, gravel, and mudflat habitats of reclaimed seaward intertidal wetlands.
      There was a significant self-restoration of species richness and diversity in
      vegetated and gravel habitats with no inflow of freshwater, but there were no
      significant changes in species diversity in three habitats subjected to
      freshwater inflow. Significant changes in community structures of macrobenthos
      occurred in vegetated and gravel habitats from pre- to post-restoration. Analysis
      of benthic health showed that gravel habitats were under moderate to high levels 
      of disturbance in pre-restoration period. In contrast, there tended to be no
      evidence of disturbance in vegetated and mudflat habitats during two
      investigations. Restoration of macrobenthos is best achieved in vegetated
      habitats with on inflow of freshwater.

TI  - An automatic restoration framework based on GPU-accelerated collateral filtering 
      in brain MR images.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1186/s12880-019-0305-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Image restoration is one of the fundamental and essential tasks
      within image processing. In medical imaging, developing an effective algorithm
      that can automatically remove random noise in brain magnetic resonance (MR)
      images is challenging. The collateral filter has been shown a more powerful
      algorithm than many existing methods. However, the computation of the collateral 
      filter is more time-consuming and the selection of the filter parameters is also 
      laborious. This paper proposes an automatic noise removal system based on the
      accelerated collateral filter for brain MR images. METHODS: To solve these
      problems, we first accelerated the collateral filter with parallel computing
      using the graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture. We adopted the compute
      unified device architecture (CUDA), an application programming interface for the 
      GPU by NVIDIA, to hasten the computation. Subsequently, the optimal filter
      parameters were selected and the automation was achieved by artificial neural
      networks. Specifically, an artificial neural network system associated with image
      feature analysis was adopted to establish the automatic image restoration
      framework. The best feature combination was selected by the paired t-test and the
      sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) methods. RESULTS: Experimental
      results indicated that not only did the proposed automatic image restoration
      algorithm perform dramatically faster than the traditional collateral filter, but
      it also effectively removed the noise in a wide variety of brain MR images. A
      speed up gain of 34 was attained to process an MR image, which completed within
      0.1 s. Representative illustrations of brain tumor images demonstrated the
      capability of identifying lesion boundaries, which outperformed many existing
      methods. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that our accelerated and automated restoration
      framework is promising for achieving robust filtering in many brain MR image
      restoration applications.

TI  - Undesired fertility restoration in msm1 barley associates with two mTERF genes.
LID - 10.1007/s00122-019-03281-9 [doi]
AB  - KEY MESSAGE: The novel Rfm3 locus causing undesired fertility restoration in the 
      msm1 cytoplasm of winter barley is located on the short arm of chromosome 6H.
      Undesired fertility restoration of cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) mother lines in
      absence of the functional Rfm1 restorer gene is a significant problem for hybrid 
      breeding in winter barley. Here, we describe that a novel restorer locus on the
      short arm of chromosome 6H, designated Rfm3, is closely linked to two
      mitochondrial transcription termination factor family (mTERF) protein coding
      genes. Genome-wide association studies in a multiparental mapping population
      revealed that two of the most significantly associated markers are located very
      close to these genes, with one marker lying directly within one mTERF gene
      sequence. Sequences of the candidate genes in the parental lines, segregating
      individuals and an independent set of breeding lines clearly revealed haplotypes 
      discriminating completely sterile, partially fertile and Rfm1-restorer lines. The
      haplotypes segregate for several single nucleotide polymorphisms, a 6 bp
      insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphism and another 2 bp InDel. CMS-unstable
      genotypes carrying haplotypes associated with undesired fertility restoration
      showed significantly higher grain setting on bagged spikes when plants were
      subjected to elevated temperatures during anthesis, indicating a temperature
      influence on pollen fertility. SNPs associated with desirable Rfm3 haplotypes can
      be implemented in marker-assisted selection of stable CMS mother lines.

TI  - Ecological restoration of eroded karst utilizing pioneer moss and vascular plant 
      species with selection based on vegetation diversity and underlying soil
      chemistry.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/15226514.2018.1474435 [doi]
AB  - Soil erosion in karst areas not only destroys the natural environment but also
      accelerates the decline in land productivity together with the associated
      increase in poverty for local communities. There are no simple or straightforward
      answers to controlling soil erosion on karst. Such erosion has become a serious
      problem in China. This study addresses both the diversity of vegetation (mosses, 
      herbs, shrubs and trees) on karst and the underlying soil chemical
      characteristics, in order to provide a scientific basis by which suitable plant
      species can be selected for recovery and restoration of karst degraded by soil
      erosion. Vegetation diversity and soil chemistry were assessed in areas with five
      different grades of soil erosion in Guiyang Karst Park, Guizhou, China. Mosses
      are more tolerant than vascular plants of soil erosion and associated
      environmental degradation of karst and the order of species diversity was: mosses
      > herbs > shrubs > trees. Mosses were found to play a major role in ecological
      restoration of microhabitats on karst. Soil microbial biomass carbon was found to
      be significantly higher in soil under mosses than in bare soil associated with
      other plant categories. Mosses were more effective in converting unavailable
      potassium to available potassium. Vascular plants were found to have a positive
      effect on total nitrogen fixation and the availability of phosphorus in the soil.
      Increasing soil degradation was associated with lower levels of total Nitrogen in
      soil underlying mosses than in soil underlying vascular plants. Thus, based on
      their different but complementary contributions to soil chemistry, mosses and
      vascular plants in combination can provide the most practical outcome for the
      repair and restoration of areas of karst affected by soil erosion. The
      combination of the moss species, Homomallium plagiangium, Cyrto-hypnum pygmaeuman
      and Brachythecium perminusculum, the herbs Veronica arvensis and Youngia
      japonica, and the tree Prunus salicina, are recommended as suitable pioneer plant
      species to cultivate for use in restoration of regions of karstic soil erosion.

TI  - Restoration of miRNA-148a in pancreatic cancer reduces invasion and metastasis by
      inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway via downregulating maternally
      expressed gene-3.
PG  - 639-648
LID - 10.3892/etm.2018.7026 [doi]
AB  - Various microRNAs (miRNA) have been recognized potential novel tumor markers and 
      have a critical role in cancer development and progression. Recently, methylation
      of miRNA-148a was identified as a crucial biochemical process in the progression 
      of cancer. However, its potential role and in pancreatic cancer as well as the
      underlying mechanisms have remained largely elusive. The present study
      investigated the potential antitumor effect of miR-148a as well as its impact on 
      invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. It was found that the expression of
      miRNA-148a and the potential predictive biomarker maternally expressed gene-3
      (MEG-3) were obviously decreased in human pancreatic cancer tissues compared with
      those in adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Furthermore, miR-148a was found to be
      downregulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with normal pancreatic
      cells through promoter methylation. An MTT assay and a clonogenic assay
      demonstrated that restoration of miRNA-148a inhibited the proliferation and
      colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, miR-148a transduction
      led to the upregulation of MEG-3 expression and promoted apoptosis of pancreatic 
      cancer cells. Western blot analysis revealed that transduction of miR-148a
      markedly decreased the expression levels of C-myc, cyclin D1 and beta-catenin in 
      pancreatic cancer cells. Methylation of miR-148a not only decreased the
      endogenous beta-catenin levels but also inhibited the nuclear translocation of
      beta-catenin to delay cell cycle progression. Furthermore, ectopic miR-148a
      methylation inhibited pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion via causing
      an upregulation of MEG-3 expression. Most importantly, ectopic overexpression of 
      miR-148a in pancreatic cancer cells inhibited tumor formation in an animal
      experiment. Taken together, miR-148a methylation is a crucial regulatory process 
      to inhibit the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, and
      transduction of miR-148a suppressed the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells 
      through negative regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The
      findings of the present study suggested that miRNA-148a acts as a tumor
      suppressor in pancreatic cancer and may contribute to the development of novel
      treatments for pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Restoration of Constitutional Alignment in TKA with a Novel Osteotomy Technique.
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1677508 [doi]
AB  - Many studies have shown that restoration of the preoperative constitutional varus
      may lead to a normal knee status in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It is also
      known that coronal femoral lateral bowing contributes to constitutional varus of 
      the femoral shaft, and bilateral femoral lateral bowing (BFLB) can decelerate
      medial knee osteoarthritis progression. In this sense, the BFLB should be
      reserved in TKA. To date, no study has yet reported the technique to reserve BFLB
      in TKA. Our study showed that the proximal and distal femur had no significant
      geometric difference between patients with varus knees and BFLB (> 5 degrees )
      and volunteers with healthy knees and straight femoral shaft. So, the virtual
      center of femoral head fell on the distal femoral mechanical axis (DMA) after
      accurate correction of the bowing, indicating that the DMA should be the femoral 
      original constitutional mechanical axis (CA). Subsequently, the distal femoral
      osteotomy was performed perpendicular to DMA in TKA, and the postoperative angle 
      formed by DMA and tibial mechanical axis (TMA) was measured to assess whether CA 
      was restored successfully. In this study, the gap balance was achieved without
      medial collateral ligaments release, and the patient's CA was successfully
      restored (range of DMA-TMA angle 178.2 degrees -179.9 degrees ). This study
      provides a novel technique to restore preoperative CA in patients with varus
      knees and BFLB. It is found that the distal femur should be cut perpendicular to 
      DMA, so the lower limb alignment and soft tissue strains can be restored to the
      preoperative state, and the knees would be stable and in a natural status after
      TKA.

AB  - The research on the plant population metal intra-specific tolerance variability
      is of paramount importance for the design of phytoremediation restoration. The
      aim of this study was to asses if any variability exists in the copper stress
      response during seed germination and seedling development in Juncus acutus
      depending on provenance habitat. Our results showed that J. acutus were able to
      germinate until Cu concentration of 23 mM Cu, but at 15 and 23 mM Cu, the final
      percentage of germination were 100 and 68% for seeds derived from polluted area
      and were 86 and 40% for those collected in non-polluted one, respectively.
      Moreover, the germination kinetic was more impaired by Cu concentration in those 
      no historically exposed to metal excess. Provenance effect was also reflected in 
      seedlings survival and development; thus at 9 mM Cu higher survival percentage,
      total height and dry mass were recorded in seedlings derived from no polluted
      area compared with their historically exposed counterparts. Therefore, we can
      conclude that the variability of Cu tolerance in J. acutus should be considered
      for the design of restoration projects, since it allows use of provenances with
      greater potential as a source of propagules highly adapted to metal excess.

      biogeography in California's San Joaquin Desert.

AB  - A recent global trend toward retirement of farmland presents opportunities to
      reclaim habitat for threatened and endangered species. We examine habitat
      restoration opportunities in one of the world's most converted landscapes,
      California's San Joaquin Desert (SJD). Despite the presence of 35 threatened and 
      endangered species, agricultural expansion continues to drive habitat loss in the
      SJD, even as marginal farmland is retired. Over the next decades a combination of
      factors, including salinization, climate change, and historical groundwater
      overdraft, are projected to lead to the retirement of more than 2,000 km2 of
      farmland in the SJD. To promote strategic habitat protection and restoration, we 
      conducted a quantitative assessment of habitat loss and fragmentation, habitat
      suitability, climatic niche stability, climate change impacts, habitat
      protection, and reintroduction opportunities for an umbrella species of the SJD, 
      the endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila). We use our suitability
      models, in conjunction with modern and historical land use maps, to estimate the 
      historical and modern rate of habitat loss to development. The estimated amount
      of habitat lost since the species became protected under endangered species law
      in 1967 is greater than the total amount of habitat currently protected through
      public ownership and conservation easement. We document climatic niche
      contraction and associated range contraction away from the more mesic margins of 
      the species' historical distribution, driven by the anthropogenic introduction of
      exotic grasses and forbs. The impact of exotic species on G. sila range dynamics 
      appears to be still unfolding. Finally, we use NASA fallowed area maps to
      identify 610 km2 of fallowed or retired agricultural land with high potential to 
      again serve as habitat. We discuss conservation strategies in light of the
      potential for habitat restoration and multiple drivers of ongoing and historical 
      habitat loss.

AB  - Bisphosphonates (BPs) used for treating skeletal diseases can induce
      bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). Despite much effort,
      effective remedies are yet to be established. In the present study, we
      investigated the feasibility of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) extracted from
      salmon sperm for the treatment of BRONJ, in a BRONJ-induced rat model. Compared
      with BRONJ-induced samples, PDRN-treated samples exhibited lower necrotic bone
      percentages and increased numbers of blood vessels and attached osteoclast
      production. Moreover, local administration of PDRN at a high concentration (8
      mg/kg) remarkably resolved the osteonecrosis. Findings from this study suggest
      that local administration of PDRN at a specific concentration may be considered
      clinically for the management of BRONJ.

AB  - Prescribed burning has been recently readopted as a management practice in the
      Central Pyrenees (NE-Spain) to stop shrub encroachment processes and recover
      pasturelands. The immediate effects of prescribed burning on soil C stocks and
      related biological properties and their evolution in the short-to mid-term after 
      burning were assessed. The study was conducted during three autumnal prescribed
      burnings in the Central Pyrenees in the municipalities of Buisan, Asin de Broto
      and Yebra de Basa. At each site, the topsoil Ah horizon was sampled at soil
      depths of 0-1, 1-2 and 2-3cm immediately before and immediately after burning.
      Additionally, seasonal samplings were conducted every 6 months up to one year in 
      the case of the Asin and Yebra sites and up to 24monthsat the Buisan site. The
      total soil organic C stock (SOCS) total N stock (NS), microbial biomass C (MBC), 
      soil basal respiration (SR) and beta-D-glucosidase activity were analyzed. The
      maximum temperatures recorded at the soil surface were 438 degrees C (Buisan),
      768 degrees C (Asin) and 595 degrees C (Yebra). At the Buisan site, burning
      significantly decreased the SOCS (-52%), NS (-44%), MBC (-57%), SR (-72%) and
      glucosidase activity (-66%) at 0-1cm depth, whereas fire had no direct effects on
      soil at the Asin and Yebra sites. The contrasting effects of burning on soil that
      were observed among sites were found to be related to differences in fire
      residence time. The prescribed fire at the Buisan site was on a plain slope under
      slow winds (<8kmh(-1)) at a burning rate of 0.64hah(-1), which produced greater
      impacts on the soil properties than the burnings at the Asin and Yebra sites,
      where fire spread rapidly (2.72 and 1.43hah(-1), respectively). At the Buisan
      site, the SOCS and NS recovered to the unburned values 24 months after burning.
      One year after burning, the SOCS at Asin were 60% higher than those of the
      unburned soils at 0-1cm depth. At all sites a decreasing trend in soil biological
      activity in the short- and mid-term was observed. From the results it can be
      concluded that: 1) the direct effects of burning on soil are highly dependent on 
      the environmental conditions, 2) in the mid-term, the reduction in soil
      biological activity and the incorporation of ashes and charred plant remains led 
      to an increase in the SOCS of the burned soils.

AB  - In the twentieth century the heavily channelized Raba River incised deeply in its
      mountain course. Abandonment of channelization structures in a 2.3-km-long reach 
      within a forested corridor was followed by considerable channel widening during
      floods of 30- and 35-year recurrence interval, re-establishment of a multi-thread
      channel pattern and island development. Morphological and botanical surveys were 
      conducted annually between 2011 and 2017 to determine the processes and patterns 
      governing development of islands and their floristic complexity. Hydraulic
      conditions promoting establishment and persistence of islands were determined
      with one-dimensional hydraulic modelling of flood flows for 8 unmanaged river
      cross-sections with islands and 8 cross-sections in the adjacent channelized
      reaches. Average age, number of islands and their average and total area in the
      reach markedly increased over the study period. However, the increase was not
      steady but moderated by island erosion by flood flows, island establishment
      shortly after major floods and island coalescence in the years without such
      floods. Hydraulic modelling indicated that river cross-sections with islands are 
      typified by significantly lower values of mean water depth, flow velocity, unit
      stream power and bed shear stress at flood flows than cross-sections in the
      adjacent, channelized reaches. Such conditions promote deposition of living
      driftwood on channel bars, initiating island development, and reduce the
      probability of erosion of existing islands. The total number of plant species on 
      islands varied highly and either exceeded or was similar to that recorded on
      riparian forest plots in particular years. This study indicates that (i) island
      re-establishment in the river was initiated by substantial channel widening, (ii)
      variation in flood magnitudes exerts a considerable influence on the trajectory
      of island development, and (iii) the contribution of islands to the overall
      species richness of plant communities in the river corridor at early stages of
      island re-establishment may be highly varied.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of a sequential combination of aerobic
      exercise and cognitive training on cognitive function and other health-related
      outcomes in stroke survivors with cognitive decline. DESIGN: Intervention study
      and randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Hospital-based rehabilitation units.
      PARTICIPANTS: Stroke survivors with cognitive decline were randomized to
      sequential combination training (SEQ; n = 15) or an active control (CON; n = 15) 
      group. Interventions The SEQ group received 30 minutes of aerobic exercise,
      followed by 30 minutes of computerized cognitive training. The CON group received
      30 minutes of non-aerobic physical exercise, followed by 30 minutes of
      unstructured mental activities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure
      was cognitive function. Secondary outcome measures included physical function,
      social participation, and quality of life. RESULTS: Compared with the CON group, 
      the SEQ group had significantly improved Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (p 
      = 0.03) and Wechsler Memory Scale (Third Edition) span scores (p = 0.012) after
      training. The endurance and mobility level measured by the 6-Minute Walk Test (p 
      = 0.25) was also enhanced in the SEQ group relative to the CON group. However,
      the transfer of sequential training to social participation (Community
      Integration Questionnaire) and quality of life (EuroQoL questionnaire) was
      limited (p > 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise combined with
      computerized cognitive training has better effects on the cognitive functional
      status of post-stroke survivors than an active control. The cognitive functional 
      status of post-stroke survivors was better after participation in aerobic
      exercise combined with computerized training than after active control therapy,
      demonstrating the clinical significance of this combination therapy.

TI  - Phytophthora Species Are Common on Nursery Stock Grown for Restoration and
      Revegetation Purposes in California.
PG  - PDIS01180167RE

AB  - Phytophthora tentaculata was detected for the first time in North America in 2012
      in a nursery on sticky monkeyflower plant (Diplacus aurantiacus) and again in
      2014 on outplanted native plants. At that time, this species was listed as a
      federally actionable and reportable pathogen by the USDA. As a result of these
      detections, California native plant nurseries were surveyed to determine the
      prevalence of Phytophthora species on native plant nursery stock. A total of 402 
      samples were collected from 26 different native plant nurseries in California
      between 2014 and 2016. Sampling focused on plants with symptoms of root and crown
      rot. Symptomatic tissue was collected and tested by immunoassay, culture, and
      molecular techniques (PCR). Identifications were made using sequences from the
      internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region, a portion of the trnM-trnP-trnM,
      or the atp9-nad9 mitochondrial regions. Phytophthora was confirmed from 149 of
      the 402 samples (37%), and from plants in 22 different host families. P.
      tentaculata was the most frequently detected species in our survey, followed by
      P. cactorum and members of the P. cryptogea complex. Other species include P.
      cambivora, P. cinnamomi, P. citricola, P. hedraiandra, P. megasperma, P.
      multivora, P. nicotianae, P. niederhauserii, P. parvispora, P. pini, P.
      plurivora, and P. riparia. A few Phytophthora sequences generated from
      mitochondrial regions could not be assigned to a species. Although this survey
      was limited to a relatively small number of California native plant nurseries,
      Phytophthora species were detected from three quarters of them (77%). In addition
      to sticky monkeyflower, P. tentaculata was detected from seven other hosts,
      expanding the number of associated hosts. During this survey, P. parvispora was
      detected for the first time in North America from symptomatic crowns and roots of
      the nonnative Mexican orange blossom (Choisya ternata). Pathogenicity of P.
      parvispora and P. nicotianae was confirmed on this host. These findings document 
      the widespread occurrence of Phytophthora spp. in native plant nurseries and
      highlight the potential risks associated with outplanting infested nursery-grown 
      stock into residential gardens and wildlands.

TI  - Knee Cell-Based Cartilage Restoration.
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1676378 [doi]
AB  - As our patients become more physically active at all ages, the incidence of
      injuries to articular cartilage is increasing causing significant pain and
      disability. The intrinsic healing response of articular cartilage is poor because
      of its limited vascular supply and capacity for chondrocyte division. Nonsurgical
      management for the focal cartilage lesion is successful in the majority of
      patients. Those patients who fail conservative management may be candidates for a
      cartilage reparative or reconstructive procedure. The type of treatment available
      depends on a multitude of lesion-specific and patient-specific variables.
      First-line therapies for isolated cartilage lesions have demonstrated good
      clinical results in the correct patient, but typically repair cartilage with
      fibrocartilage, which has inferior stiffness, inferior resilience, and poorer
      wear characteristics. Advances in cell-based cartilage restoration have provided 
      the surgeon a means to address focal cartilage lesions utilizing mesenchymal stem
      cells, chondrocytes, and biomimetic scaffolds to restore hyaline cartilage.

TI  - How maintenance and restoration measures mediate the response of riparian plant
      functional composition to environmental gradients on channel margins: Insights
      from a highly degraded large river.
PG  - 1312-1325
LID - S0048-9697(18)34789-2 [pii]

AB  - Riparian habitats are transitional zones where strong environmental gradients
      shape community. To prevent flood risks and channel migration on managed rivers, 
      civil engineering techniques have been widely used. Recently, ecological
      restoration of rivers has become a major issue. However, given the alteration of 
      natural disturbance regimes induced by human infrastructures, the real
      added-value of these restoration actions is questionable. Thus, a major challenge
      is to better understand whether changes in abiotic conditions induced by human
      activity influence the response of plant communities to environmental gradients. 
      Studying a highly degraded large river, we evaluated the effect of the elevation 
      and soil texture gradients on plant functional composition and assessed whether
      human-mediated environment gradients, achieved through maintenance and
      restoration measures, shape community structure. In the summer of 2017, we
      sampled 17 geomorphic surfaces, mostly gravel bars, along the Rhone River and its
      tributaries that were either repeatedly cleared (brush clearing vs plowing),
      newly reprofiled or naturally rejuvenated by high flows. The results show shifts 
      in trait values with elevation and convergence in plant traits with increasing
      proportion of fine sediments. The co-occurrence of species with contrasting
      traits was higher in highly disturbed environments, revealing the importance of
      rejuvenation processes. However, the influence of both environmental gradients
      was mediated by human activity. For maintenance measures, plowing was better able
      to promote species diversity and limited biotic homogenization along
      environmental gradients. Among the three geomorphic surfaces, naturally
      rejuvenated bars were the most stressful environments, hosting distinct
      functional assemblages, while communities on newly reprofiled banks were in the
      same ecological trajectories as repeatedly cleared bars. To promote an effective 
      ecological restoration of riparian zones, (i) a greater variability of the
      minimum flow is needed, (ii) bedload transport restoration should be a priority
      and (iii) reprofiled banks should better mimic the landforms of natural river
      margins.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the factors associated with non-closure of protective
      ileostomy after anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectum excision
      for rectal cancer, the morbidity associated with the closure of ileostomies and
      the rate of permanent ileostomy in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: 
      we conducted a retrospective study with 174 consecutive patients diagnosed with
      rectal tumors, of whom 92 underwent anterior resection of the rectum with
      coloanal or colorectal anastomosis and protective ileostomy, with curative
      intent. We carried out a multivariate analysis to determine the factors
      associated with definite permanence of the stoma, as well as studied the
      morbidity of patients who underwent bowel continuity restoration. RESULTS: In the
      84-month follow-up period, 54 of the 92 patients evaluated (58.7%) had the
      ileostomy closed and 38 (41.3%) remained with the stoma. Among the 62 patients
      who had the ileostomy closed, 11 (17.7%) presented some type of postoperative
      complication: three had ileal anastomosis dehiscence, five had intestinal
      obstruction, two had surgical wound infection, and one, pneumonia. Eight of these
      patients required a new stoma. CONCLUSION: according to the multivariate
      analysis, the factors associated with stoma permanence were anastomotic fistula, 
      presence of metastases and closure of the ileostomy during chemotherapy.

TI  - The K2P -channel TASK1 affects Oligodendroglial differentiation but not myelin
      restoration.
LID - 10.1002/glia.23577 [doi]
AB  - In multiple sclerosis, demyelination occurs as a consequence of chronic
      autoimmunity in the central nervous system causing progressive neurological
      impairment in patients. After a demyelinating event, new myelin sheaths are
      formed by adult oligodendroglial progenitor cells; a process called
      remyelination. However, remyelination often fails in multiple sclerosis due to
      insufficient recruitment and differentiation of oligodendroglial precursor cells.
      A pivotal role for the two-pore-domain potassium (K2P ) channel, TASK1, has
      already been proven for an animal model of multiple sclerosis. However, the
      mechanisms underlying the TASK1-mediated effects are still elusive. Here, we
      tested the role of TASK1 channels in oligodendroglial differentiation and
      remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination in male mice. We found TASK1 
      channels to be functionally expressed on primary murine and human, pluripotent
      stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes. Lack of TASK1 channels resulted in an
      increase of mature oligodendrocytes in vitro as well as a higher number of mature
      oligodendrocytes and accelerated developmental myelination in vivo.
      Mechanistically, Task1-deficient cells revealed a higher amount of phosphorylated
      WNK1, a kinase known to be involved in the downstream signaling of the
      myelination regulator LINGO-1. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of genetic
      TASK1 ablation or pharmacological TASK1 inhibition on disease-related
      remyelination. Neither channel inhibition nor lack of TASK1 channels promoted
      remyelination after pathological demyelination. In summary, we conclude that
      functional TASK1 channels participate in the modulation of differentiating
      oligodendroglial cells in a previously unknown manner. However, while being
      involved in developmental myelination our data suggest that TASK1 channels have
      no major effect on remyelination.

TI  - Secondary procedures for restoration of upper limb function in late cases of
      neonatal brachial plexus palsy.
LID - 10.1007/s00590-019-02362-1 [doi]
AB  - Neonatal brachial plexus palsy is a devastating complication after a difficult
      delivery. The incidence of this injury has not significantly decreased over the
      past decades, despite all the advances in perinatal care. Although primary repair
      of the nerves with microsurgical techniques is the common treatment strategy
      nowadays, there are late cases in which secondary procedures in tendons or bones 
      are necessary. Moreover, secondary procedures may be needed to improve the
      results of primary repair. A careful preoperative assessment of all the residual 
      defects and deformities in upper limbs of these patients is essential. The aim of
      these procedures is usually to restore the deficient shoulder abduction and
      external rotation, release of any elbow flexion contracture or to correct a weak 
      elbow flexion. More distally a supination or pronation deformity is usually
      apparent, and available options include tendon transfers or radial osteotomy. The
      wrist of these patients may be ulnarly deviated or may has absent extension, so
      tendon transfers or free muscle transfers can also be used for correction of
      these deformities. In severe cases, wrist fusion is an alternative option. The
      clinical presentation of the hand is highly variable due to complex deformities
      including thumb adduction deformity, metacarpophalangeal joints drop, and weak
      finger flexion or extension depending on the level of the injury. Each of these
      deformities can be restored with a combination of soft tissue procedures like
      local or free muscle transfer and bony procedures like arthrodesis.

TI  - Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway impedes the restoration of
      neurological function following hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in a neonatal
      rabbit model.
LID - 10.1002/jcb.28302 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD), frequently occurring in infancy 
      and childhood, is a major cause of mortality and severe neurologic impairment.
      This study was performed to examine the effect of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway 
      on HIBD in a neonatal rabbit model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Uterine artery
      occlusion was used to establish HIBD models in neonatal rabbits, which were then 
      subjected to sham operation, dimethyl sulfoxide (2 mL) or LY294002 (inhibitor of 
      PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, 6.4 mug/kg). Behavioral neurological assessment was
      performed in neonatal rabbits delivered by cesarean section, after which serum
      neuron-specific enolase (NSE) level and cerebral water content were determined.
      The level of cleaved caspase-3 level and apoptosis of neurons were observed by
      immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
      nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Furthermore, the expression of PI3K/Akt
      signaling pathway- and apoptosis-related factors was examined. RESULTS: In
      neonatal rabbits, HIBD increased the fetal death rate; reduced neurological
      scores of posture, righting reflex, and deglutition reflex; elevated serum NSE
      levels, cerebral water content, cleaved caspase-3-positive expression in
      hippocampal CA1 region and apoptotic neurons; inactivated PI3K/Akt signaling
      pathway as well as reduced Bcl-2 expression and increased BAD and Bax expression.
      Notably, the treatment of LY294002 further aggravated neurological impairment in 
      neonatal rabbits in response to HIBD. CONCLUSION: Following the HIBD caused by
      intrauterine asphyxia, the LY294002 administered through auricular vein infusion 
      into pregnant rabbits exacerbates neurological impairment of neonatal rabbits,
      suggesting that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may serve as a candidate
      therapeutic target for neurological recovery.

      ART with composite resin after 12 months.
LID - 10.1007/s00784-018-2787-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of class II restorations, in
      permanent teeth, through the ART technique in comparison to composite resin.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants (154), aged 8 to 19 years, with good general 
      health, with class II cavities in permanent teeth, and without pulp involvement
      and tooth pain were included in this parallel and randomized clinical trial. The 
      Ethics Committee approval number was CAAE: 24012913.0.1001.5417. Seventy-seven
      restorations were made with each restorative material (Equia Fil-GC Corporation
      and Z350-3M). Evaluations occurred at 6 and 12 months by the criteria of ART and 
      the USPHS modified. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney, chi-square, Fisher's
      exact, chi-square tests with linear trend and logistic regression by enter method
      (p < 0.050). The Kaplan-Meier test evaluated the survival rates of the
      restorations. The log-rank test compared the survival curves. RESULTS: Regardless
      of the evaluation criteria used, the success rates of ART restorations were 98.7%
      (6 months) and 95.8% (12 months) and for composite resins were 100% (6 months)
      and 98.7% (12 months), with no statistical difference of restoration groups (p > 
      0.050). Survival rates for restorations, regardless of the evaluation criteria
      used, are the same as the success rates, with the exception of ART restorations
      at 12 months of follow-up (94.8%). CONCLUSION: No differences in the success
      rates of class II restorations of ART compared to resin composite, in permanent
      teeth, were observed after 12 months. CLINIC SIGNIFICANT: HVGIC can safely be
      used to restore proximal cavities in permanent teeth up to 12 months.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the current status of advanced cartilage restoration
      procedures among newly trained orthopaedic surgeons in the United States.
      METHODS: The American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery database was queried to
      identify all advanced cartilage restoration procedure cases submitted by American
      Board of Orthopaedic Surgery part II board certification examination candidates
      from 2003 to 2015. All documented autologous chondrocyte implantation, autologous
      osteochondral transfer, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and marrow
      stimulation techniques (MSTs) procedures were analyzed. Analysis was performed to
      describe trends in annual incidence, types of complications, concomitant
      procedures, and geographical differences in incidence of advanced cartilage
      procedures. RESULTS: From 2003 to 2015, a total of 2,827 surgeons submitted 7,522
      cartilage restoration procedures, with 7,060 cases documented as MST (80.01%).
      The number of cartilage cases decreased significantly from 2003 to in 2015 (P
      <.001), with MST having the largest decline (P < .001). The incidence of open
      osteochondral allograft transplantation (odds ratio = 1.35; P = .023) and open
      autologous osteochondral transfer (odds ratio = 0.84; P = .004) increased over
      the study period. Overall, the majority of patients (57.0%) were male; however,
      female patients were on average significantly older than male patients (P <
      .001). Cartilage procedures were performed concomitantly with a realignment
      osteotomy procedure in 1.7% of cases. The incidence of surgical complications
      increased throughout the study period from 2.9% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2015 (P <
      .001). CONCLUSIONS: Cartilage restoration procedures, specifically MSTs, are
      being decreasingly performed among recently trained orthopaedic surgeons. In
      contrast, complication rates have been increasing since 2003, demonstrating a
      possible paradigm shift toward more complex cartilage procedures, specifically
      osteochondral grafting procedures. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates a 
      significant decline in the use of MSTs by recently trained orthopaedic surgeons. 
      In addition, an increase in several more complex cartilage restoration procedures
      was found. Taken in sum, these changes may reflect a shift in residency and
      fellowship training away from marrow stimulation procedures that elicit a
      fibrocartilage reparative tissue and toward more complex procedures that provide 
      a more hyaline-like articular cartilage surface.

AB  - Cartilage restoration procedures appear to be increasing in popularity and are
      being performed more frequently for older patients according to a recent analysis
      of database data. Chondroplasty and microfracture are most commonly performed;
      however, chondrocyte transfer procedures, including osteochondral autologous
      transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation, are being performed more
      commonly. Relatively few corrective osteotomies are being performed in
      conjunction with these procedures; this is concerning because surgeons are either
      not looking for malalignment or not correcting it. Please, when performing joint 
      preservation surgery, don't put down the saw!

TI  - The Efficacy of Platelet-Rich Plasma in the Field of Hair Restoration and Facial 
      Aesthetics-A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1203475418818073
LID - 10.1177/1203475418818073 [doi]
AB  - As a promising alternative to traditional treatment, platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
      is being used to encourage hair growth through the release of growth factors and 
      cytokines. In addition to hair restoration, PRP's multifactorial capabilities can
      also be used to treat aging skin, facial scarring, and acne. The purpose of this 
      review is to critically examine the success of PRP in the field of dermatology,
      with specific attention to the role of PRP in hair restoration. Where possible,
      meta-analyses were used to evaluate the efficacy of PRP. In androgenetic alopecia
      (AGA) patients, 3 monthly PRP injections (1 session administered every month for 
      3 months) exhibited greater efficacy over placebo as measured by change in total 
      hair density (hair/cm(2)) over the treatment period (mean difference: 25.61, 95% 
      CI: 4.45 to 46.77; P = .02). The studies included in the meta-analysis used a
      half-head design, which may have influenced the results because of the effects
      PRP can induce. Controlled studies suggest that 2 to 4 sessions of PRP combined
      with traditional therapies and procedures can help minimize acne scarring and
      facial burns, improve aesthetic results, and decrease recovery time. However,
      data for these indications are lacking and are less robust in design. In
      conclusion, to achieve an improvement in hair restoration in patients with mild
      AGA, 3 initial monthly PRP injections should be given. Only upon completion of
      rigorous, randomized, controlled studies can standardized and effective PRP
      protocols for treating dermatology conditions such as acne scarring, facial
      burns, and aging skin be determined.

TI  - Effects of the natural restoration time of abandoned farmland in a semiarid
      region on the soil denitrification rates and abundance and community structure of
      denitrifying bacteria.
LID - 10.1007/s00253-018-09575-0 [doi]
AB  - Denitrification accounts for the production of mobile forms of nitrogen (N) for
      plant uptake, N leaching, and gaseous losses. However, few studies have
      investigated the potential effects of the natural restoration age on
      denitrification rates and denitrifying microorganisms, especially in fragile
      ecosystems in semiarid regions. The potential N gas (N2O and N2) emissions and
      denitrification rates significantly decreased after abandonment (< 9 years)
      compared to those of active farmland and then steadily increased as the
      restoration proceeded, leading to an enhanced soil N loss. The total bacterial
      and napA gene abundances significantly decreased after abandonment (< 9 years)
      compared to that of farmland and then significantly increased as the restoration 
      proceeded. The abundances of the narG, nirK, nirS, qnorB, and nosZ genes steadily
      increased with the restoration age of abandoned farmland. The community
      compositions of denitrifying bacteria exhibited different fluctuating patterns,
      suggesting different response patterns of community traits of N gas
      emission-related functional guilds to the restoration age of abandoned farmland. 
      Changes in N gas emissions and in the abundance and diversity of denitrifying
      microorganisms exhibited similar patterns, suggesting an increased population and
      diversity of denitrifying bacteria are responsible for the enhanced N gas
      emissions. We observed clear patterns of plant coverage and denitrifying
      microorganisms that were associated with increases in the organic C, NH4(+)-N,
      and NO3(-)-N contents and decreases in the soil bulk density as well as increases
      in the abundance and diversity of denitrifiers with the restoration age of
      abandoned farmland that were linked to an increase in N gas emissions. It is
      therefore recommended that effective measures (i.e., modest levels of grazing)
      may be able to be undertaken to assist with decreasing greenhouse gas nitrous
      oxide (N2O) and N loss after 32 years of farmland abandonment.

AB  - Wetland restoration is a major objective of environmental management worldwide.
      We present a frameworkat the regional level that prioritizes historical
      biodiversity and restoration suitability. The goal of the framework is to
      maximize biodiversity gains from restoration while minimizing the cost. We used
      C-Plan, a prioritization tool for systematic conservation planning (SCP), to
      balance the biodiversity gains withthe costs of restoration, or restoration
      suitability. We overlaid historical spatial data from 1995 to estimate historical
      distributions of 91 biodiversity features. These features were used to conduct an
      irreplaceability analysis to assess the restoration value of historical
      biodiversity. We then modelled restoration suitability based on environmental
      data of six criteria. Finally, we applied a complementarity analysis to achieve
      the quantitative targets of all biodiversity features while minimizing the cost
      of restoration. We tested this framework in the highly degraded wetlands
      ofSanjiang Plain, China. By applying our framework to Sanjiang Plain, we
      successfully identified areas with both high restoration value and high
      restoration suitability. The area of this cost-effective plan was an extension of
      4620km(2), covering 80% of the disappearing wetlands and 4% of the total Sanjiang
      Plain. Compared to the restoration value-only plan, which had an extension of
      4486km(2), the cost-effective plan covered a little more area to achievethe
      targets forall biodiversity features but with lower implementation costs where
      the proportion of high restoration suitability increases from 43% to 50%.Our
      prioritization framework can be used to analyse regional restoration efforts in
      other regions and ecosystems, and inform planners on how to maximize biodiversity
      gains while minimizing costs.

AB  - The bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is a microorganism developed as a
      vaccine for tuberculosis 100 years ago and used as therapy for bladder cancer 40 
      years ago. More recently, BCG has shown therapeutic promise for type 1 diabetes
      (T1D) and several other autoimmune diseases. In T1D, BCG restored blood sugars to
      near normal, even in patients with advanced disease of >20 years duration. This
      clinically important effect may be driven by resetting of the immune system and
      the shifting of glucose metabolism from overactive oxidative phosphorylation, a
      state of minimal sugar utilization, to aerobic glycolysis, a state of high
      glucose utilization, for energy production. The mechanistic findings support the 
      Hygiene Hypothesis and reveal the immune and metabolic synergy of mycobacterial
      reintroduction in modern humans.

AB  - Drainage is a globally common disturbance in forested peatlands that impacts peat
      soils, forest communities, and associated ecosystem functions, calling for
      informed hydrologic restoration strategies. The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), located
      in Virginia and North Carolina, U.S.A., has been altered since colonial times,
      particularly by extensive ditch networks installed to lower water levels and
      facilitate timber harvests. Consequently, peat decomposition rates have
      accelerated, and red maple has become the dominant tree species, reducing the
      historical mosaic of bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pocosin stands.
      Recent repair and installation of water control structures aim to control
      drainage and, in doing so, enhance forest community composition and preserve peat
      depths. To help inform these actions, we established five transects of 15 plots
      each (75 plots total) along a hydrologic gradient where we measured continuous
      water levels and ecosystem attributes, including peat depths, microtopography,
      and forest composition and structure. We found significant differences among
      transects, with wetter sites having thicker peat, lower red maple importance,
      greater tree density, and higher overall stand richness. Plot-level analyses
      comported with these trends, clearly grouping plots by transects (via nonmetric
      multidimensional scaling) and resulting in significant correlations between
      specific hydrologic metrics and ecosystem attributes. Our findings highlight
      hydrologic controls on soil carbon storage, forest structure, and maple
      dominance, with implications for large-scale hydrologic restoration at GDS and in
      other degraded forested peatlands more broadly.

AB  - Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) is a network designed and planned to deliver 
      a wide range of ecosystem services and to protect biodiversity. Existing GBI
      designs lacked a systematic method to allocate restoration zones. This study
      proposes a novel approach for systematically selecting cost-effective areas for
      restoration on the basis of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and ecosystem
      condition to give an optimal spatial design of GBI. The approach was tested at a 
      regional scale, in a transboundary setting encompassing the Intercontinental
      Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean in Andalusia (Spain) - Morocco (IBRM),
      across three aquatic ecosystems: freshwater, coastal and marine. We applied
      Marxan with Zones to stakeholder-defined scenarios of GBI in the IBRM.
      Specifically, we aimed to identify management zones within the GBl that addressed
      different conservation, restoration and exploitation objectives. Although almost 
      all conservation targets were achieved, our results highlighted that the
      proportion of conservation features (i.e., biodiversity, ecosystem services) that
      would be compromised in the GBl, and the proportion of provisioning services that
      would be lost due to conservation (i.e., incidental representation) are
      potentially large, indicating that the probability of conflicts between
      conservation and exploitation goals in the area is high. The implementation of
      restoration zones improved connectivity across the GBI, and also achieved
      European and global policy targets. Our approach may help guide future
      applications of GBI to implement the flexible conservation management that
      aquatic environments require, considering many areas at different spatial scales,
      across multiple ecosystems, and in transboundary contexts.

AB  - Overall survival of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      has significantly improved with platinum-based salt treatments and recently with 
      targeted therapies and immunotherapies. However, treatment failure occurs due to 
      acquired or emerging tumor resistance. We developed a monoclonal antibody against
      the proform of neurotensin (LF-NTS mAb) that alters the homeostasis of tumors
      overexpressing NTSR1. Neurotensin is frequently overexpressed along with its high
      affinity receptor (NTSR1) in tumors from epithelial origins. This ligand/receptor
      complex contributes to the progression of many tumor types by activation of the
      cellular effects involved in tumor progression (proliferation, survival,
      migration, and invasion). We demonstrate that LF-NTS mAb operates on the
      plasticity of tumor cells overexpressing NTSR1 and lowers their aggressiveness.
      The mAb enables the restoration of platinum-based therapies responsiveness, while
      also decreasing metastatic processes. Efficacy dosage with long-term treatment
      showed no obvious adverse events, while demonstrating improvement in the
      performance status. Our data suggests that LF-NTS mAb is an ideal candidate to be
      safely added to the conventional standard of care in order to improve its
      efficacy.

TI  - Enhancing the success of functional restoration using complementary and

      study in active duty service members with chronic pain.
PG  - 100311

AB  - Chronic pain significantly impairs physical, psychological and social
      functioning. Among military populations, pain due to injuries sustained both on
      and off the battlefield is a leading cause of short and long-term disability.
      Improving the quality of pain care for active duty service members is a major
      priority of the Department of Defense. This article describes an ongoing
      comparative effectiveness study which aims to (1) evaluate the benefit of a
      multimodal complementary and integrative health (CIH) pain management program
      when added to standard rehabilitative care (SRC) prior to an intensive functional
      restoration (FR) program compared to SRC alone, and (2) identify factors that
      predict improvement in pain impact following treatment completion. Using a
      randomized controlled trial design, active duty service members with pain related
      to musculoskeletal injury are assigned to a 3-week course of either SRC or SRC
      combined with CIH therapies prior to beginning a 3-week course of FR. Outcomes
      are collected at baseline, at the end of stage 1 treatment, post-FR, and at 3-
      and 6-months post-FR. Outcome measures include provider-measured functional
      assessments and patient-reported assessment through the Pain Assessment Screening
      Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR). The military health system provides a
      supportive environment for implementation of this research protocol. Challenges
      to conducting the study have included new technology systems at the study site,
      slower than projected enrollment, and program delivery issues. These challenges
      have been successfully managed and have not significantly impacted study
      participant enrollment and completion of study treatments.

AB  - With increasing awareness of the importance of wetlands, the number of new or
      restored wetlands in China is steadily growing; however, not all of them fulfill 
      their expected ecological function. Maintaining wetlands in their optimal state
      is an urgent problem that requires research into the ecosystem evaluation,
      regulation, and biomass management of wetlands. The Ecopath with Ecosim (EWE)
      model, also known as the ecological channel model, is a balance model that can
      directly construct the ecological system structure and describe its energy flow
      and mass transfer through the principle of nutrition dynamics. Here, the EWE
      model is applied to determine the ecosystem status of a newly restored wetland,
      Zhushanhu wetland, in the Lake Tai buffer zone of Zhushan Bay, and evaluate the
      current ecological regulations and biomass control measures. Our results provide 
      theoretical and scientific support for the management and maintenance of wetland 
      ecological restorations.

TI  - Novel Treatment of Hypertension by Specifically Targeting E2F for Restoration of 
      Endothelial Dihydrofolate Reductase and eNOS Function Under Oxidative Stress.
PG  - 179-189
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.11643 [doi]
AB  - We have shown that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) downregulates tetrahydrobiopterin
      salvage enzyme DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) to result in eNOS (endothelial NO
      synthase) uncoupling and elevated blood pressure. Here, we aimed to delineate
      molecular mechanisms underlying H2O2 downregulation of endothelial DHFR by
      examining transcriptional pathways hypothesized to modulate DHFR expression and
      effects on blood pressure regulation of targeting these novel mechanisms. H2O2
      dose and time dependently attenuated DHFR mRNA and protein expression and
      enzymatic activity in endothelial cells. Deletion of E2F-binding sites, but not
      those of Sp1 (specificity protein 1), abolished H2O2 attenuation of DHFR promoter
      activity. Overexpression of E2F1/2/3a activated DHFR promoter at baseline and
      alleviated the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on DHFR promoter activity. H2O2
      treatment diminished mRNA and protein expression of E2F1/2/3a, whereas
      overexpression of E2F isoforms increased DHFR protein levels. Chromatin
      immunoprecipitation assay indicated direct binding of E2F1/2/3a to the DHFR
      promoter, which was weakened by H2O2. E2F1 RNA interference attenuated DHFR
      protein levels, whereas its overexpression elevated tetrahydrobiopterin levels
      and tetrahydrobiopterin/dihydrobiopterin ratios in vitro and in vivo. In Ang II
      (angiotensin II)-infused mice, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of E2F1
      markedly abrogated blood pressure to control levels, by restoring endothelial
      DHFR function to improve NO bioavailability and vasorelaxation. Bioinformatic
      analyses confirmed a positive correlation between E2F1 and DHFR in human
      endothelial cells and arteries, and downregulation of both by oxidized
      phospholipids. In summary, endothelial DHFR is downregulated by H2O2
      transcriptionally via an E2F-dependent mechanism, and that specifically targeting
      E2F1/2/3a to restore DHFR and eNOS function may serve as a novel therapeutic
      option for the treatment of hypertension.

AB  - In semiarid terrestrial ecosystems, optimized eco-rehabilitation strategies, such
      as land preparations and planting vegetation, are keys to achieve a successful
      ecological restoration. Land preparations and vegetation are supposed to have the
      coupled and respective impacts on soil ecosystem services, which are still
      unclear now. In this study, eighteen experimental plots with six different
      combinations and repetitions of land preparations and vegetation were built in
      the Chinese Loess Plateau in 2014 and soil moisture storages (SMS), soil carbon
      stocks (SCS) and other soil nutrient stocks were calculated at 0-100cm, also the 
      effects of land preparations and planting vegetation on soil eco-hydrological
      services are analyzed by mathematical methods. The results show that leveled
      ditches-M. sativa had the highest SMS (125mm) while zig terraces-P. tabulaeformis
      had the lowest values (88mm). Fish-scale pits-P. tabulaeformis had the most SCS
      (9804g/m(2)) and leveled ditches-M. sativa had the lowest values (8163g/m(2)).
      For soil nutrient stocks, leveled benches-C. microphylla and fish-scale pits-P.
      tabulaeformis had the highest levels while leveled ditches-M. sativa had the
      lowest values. The partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) and variation partitioning 
      (VP) analysis indicated that soil nutrient stocks were most affected by the
      coupling effects of land preparation and vegetation. SMS at surface (0-10cm) were
      mainly affected by precipitation (58.8%). Furthermore, SMS at subsurface
      (10-60cm) and deep soil layer (60-100cm) were affected by the shared effects of
      vegetation and land preparation (61.3%), and vegetation (72.2%), respectively.
      The findings quantified the coupling and respective contributions of vegetation
      restoration and land preparation to soil eco-hydrological services and
      demonstrate that the optimal combination of eco-rehabilitation strategies can
      achieve a sustainable land restoration.

AB  - Approximately 15% of globally diagnosed breast cancers are designated as triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we investigated the effect of the
      natural compound, Bis(2- ethyl hexyl) 1H-pyrrole-3,4-dicarboxylate (TCCP),
      purified from Tinospora cordifolia on MDA-MB-231, a TNBC cell line. The
      pro-apoptotic nature of TCCP on MDA-MB-231 was determined by assessing various
      apoptotic markers. ROS generation, intracellular calcium, mitochondrial membrane 
      potential (DeltaPsim), MPTP, cardiolipin peroxidation and caspase activity were
      determined fluorometrically. BAX, BCL-2, cytochrome c, caspases, and p53 protein 
      expressions were determined by immunoblotting. Further, the effect of TCCP on DNA
      and cell death was determined by DNA fragmentation assay, annexin-V staining, and
      cell cycle analysis. TCCP treatment caused endogenous ROS generation, increase in
      intracellular calcium and phosphorylation of p53 in a concentration-dependent
      manner, which was reverted upon pre-treatment with pifithrin-mu. This led to the 
      downstream altered expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, mitochondrial membrane
      depolarization, MPTP, and cardiolipin peroxidation. TCCP induced cytochrome c
      release into the cytosol, caspase activation, ultimately resulting in DNA
      fragmentation. Further, induction of apoptosis and morphological alterations were
      evident from the phosphatidylserine externalization and increase in sub G1
      population. The in vivo Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) mouse study revealed the
      effectiveness of TCCP in reducing the tumor burden and resulted in a ~2 fold
      increase in mice survival with minimal hepato-renal toxicity. Overall, TCCP was
      shown to be efficient in inducing ROS and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by
      restoring p53 activity in MDA-MB-231cells and also induced EAT cell death in vivo
      thereby inhibiting tumor proliferation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated the fusion process between
      amorphous microparticles of the calcium salt of the physiological polymer
      comprising orthophosphate units, of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), and enamel. 
      METHODS: This polymer was incorporated as an ingredient into toothpaste and the
      fusion process was studied by electron microscopy and by synchrotron-based X-ray 
      tomography microscopy (SRXTM) techniques. RESULTS: The data showed that
      toothpaste, supplemented with the amorphous Ca-polyP microparticles
      (aCa-polyP-MP), not only reseals tooth defects on enamel, like carious lesions,
      and dentin, including exposed dentinal tubules, but also has the potential to
      induce re-mineralization in the enamel and dentin regions. The formation of a
      regeneration mineralic zone on the tooth surface induced by aCa-polyP-MP was
      enhanced upon exposure to artificial saliva, as demonstrated by SRXTM. Energy
      dispersive X-ray analysis revealed an increase in the calcium/phosphorus atomic
      ratio of the enamel deposits to values characteristic for the particles during
      the treatment with polyP applied in the toothpaste, indicating a fusion of the
      particles with the tooth mineral. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that
      toothpaste enriched with aCa-polyP-MP is a promising biomimetic material for
      accelerating enamel and dentin restoration.

AB  - Magnetic microparticles (MPs) have been recently proposed as innovative and
      promising dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) adsorbents. However, before using 
      them in a whole-lake restoration project, it is essential to assess their
      toxicological effects (direct and indirect) on aquatic biota. In the present
      study we hypothesized that zooplankton community is affected by MPs used for lake
      restoration. To test our hypothesis we designed a microcosms experiment (n=15)
      containing lake water and surface sediment from a hypertrophic lake. Temporal
      changes (70days) on physico-chemical conditions and on zooplankton structure
      (rotifers, copepods and branchiopods) were monitored under different scenarios.
      In particular, three different treatments were considered: no addition of MPs
      (control) and MPs addition (1.4gMPsL(-1)) on the surface water layer (T-W) and on
      the sediment (T-S). After 24h of contact time, MPs were removed with a magnetic
      rake. A total of 15 zooplankton species (12 rotifers, 1 branchiopod and 2
      copepods) were recorded and a high abundance of zooplankton was registered during
      the experiment for all treatments. No significant differences (RM-ANOVA test;
      p>0.05) in total abundance, species richness and species diversity among
      treatments were found. The absence of any effect of MPs on zooplankton can be
      explained because MPs did not significantly alter any of its physico-chemical
      (e.g. temperature, pH, O2) or biological (e.g. food quantity and quality)
      drivers. These results confirm the suitability of MPs as a promising tool for
      removing DIP in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Annually, sand and gravel processing generates approximately 20 million tonnes of
      non-commercial by-product as fine silt particles (<63mum) which constitutes
      approximately 20% of quarry production in the UK. This study is significant as it
      investigated the use of quarry silt as a sub-soil medium to partially substitute 
      soil-forming materials whilst facilitating successful post-restoration crop
      establishment. In a glasshouse pot experiment, top-soil and sub-soil layering was
      simulated, generating an artificial sub-soil medium by mixing two quarry
      non-commercial by-products, i.e. silt and overburden. These were blended in three
      ratios (100:0, 70:30, 50:50). Pots were packed to two bulk densities (1.3 and
      1.5g cm-3) and sown with three cover crops used in the early restoration process 
      namely winter rye (Secale cereale), white mustard (Sinapis alba) and a grassland 
      seed mixture (Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense, Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra).
      Three weeks into growth, the first signs of nitrogen (N) deficiency were observed
      in mustard plants, with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) deficiencies observed at
      35 days. Rye exhibited minor N deficiency symptoms four weeks into growth, whilst
      the grassland mixture showed no deficiency symptoms. The 70:30 silt:overburden
      sub-soil blend resulted in significantly higher Root Mass Densities of grassland 
      seed mixture and rye in the sub-soil layer as compared with the other blends. The
      innovation in this work is the detailed physical, chemical and biological
      characterisation of silt:overburden blends and effects on root development of
      plants commonly used in early restoration to bio-engineer soil structural
      improvements.

TI  - Anthropogenic habitat alteration leads to rapid loss of adaptive variation and

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1811559115 [doi]
AB  - Phenotypic variation is critical for the long-term persistence of species and
      populations. Anthropogenic activities have caused substantial shifts and
      reductions in phenotypic variation across diverse taxa, but the underlying
      mechanism(s) (i.e., phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic evolution) and long-term
      consequences (e.g., ability to recover phenotypic variation) are unclear. Here we
      investigate the widespread and dramatic changes in adult migration
      characteristics of wild Chinook salmon caused by dam construction and other
      anthropogenic activities. Strikingly, we find an extremely robust association
      between migration phenotype (i.e., spring-run or fall-run) and a single locus,
      and that the rapid phenotypic shift observed after a recent dam construction is
      explained by dramatic allele frequency change at this locus. Furthermore,
      modeling demonstrates that continued selection against the spring-run phenotype
      could rapidly lead to complete loss of the spring-run allele, and an empirical
      analysis of populations that have already lost the spring-run phenotype reveals
      they are not acting as sustainable reservoirs of the allele. Finally, ancient DNA
      analysis suggests the spring-run allele was abundant in historical habitat that
      will soon become accessible through a large-scale restoration (i.e., dam removal)
      project, but our findings suggest that widespread declines and extirpation of the
      spring-run phenotype and allele will challenge reestablishment of the spring-run 
      phenotype in this and future restoration projects. These results reveal the
      mechanisms and consequences of human-induced phenotypic change and highlight the 
      need to conserve and restore critical adaptive variation before the potential for
      recovery is lost.

AB  - China has made considerable efforts to mitigate the pollution of lakes over the
      past decade, but the success rate of these restoration actions at a national
      scale remains unclear. The present study compiled a 13-year (2005-2017)
      comprehensive dataset consisting of 24,319 records from China's 142 lakes and
      reservoirs. We developed a novel Water Quality Index (WQI-DET), customized to
      China's water quality classification scheme, to investigate the spatio-temporal
      pollution patterns. The likelihood of regime shifts during our study period is
      examined with a sequential algorithm. Our analysis suggests that China's lake
      water quality has improved and is also characterized by two WQI-DET abrupt shifts
      in 2007 and 2010. However, we also found that the eutrophication problems have
      not been eradicated and heavy metal (HM) pollution displayed an increasing trend.
      Our study suggests that the control of Cr, Cd and As should receive particular
      attention in an effort to alleviate the severity of HM pollution. Priority
      strategies to control HM pollution include the reduction of the contribution from
      mining activities and implementation of soil remediation in highly polluted
      areas. The mitigation efforts of lake eutrophication are more complicated due to 
      the increasing importance of internal nutrient loading that can profoundly
      modulate the magnitude and timing of system response to external nutrient loading
      reduction strategies. We also contend that the development of a rigorous
      framework to quantify the socioeconomic benefits from well-functioning lake and
      reservoir ecosystems is critically important to gain leeway and keep the
      investments to the environment going, especially if the water quality
      improvements in many Chinese lakes and reservoirs are not realized in a timely
      manner.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands are of great importance to European biodiversity. Their
      restoration in mountain regions often presents specific problems of raw soil
      stabilisation and difficult climatic conditions. Methods used to tackle these
      problems include increasing sowing density and fertilisation. However, past
      studies were performed at only one site or for a short time and do not clearly
      show how site traits and time affect restoration results. In six field
      experiments undertaken on raw soils in the Italian Alps, the effects of sowing
      density, fertilisation, soil, and climate on the development over time of plant
      density and cover were analysed over three to six years. The seed was collected
      from nearby grasslands and sown at rates of 335-21,410seedsm(-2). During the
      first one-two years, the percentage of seeds producing established plants at low 
      seed rates was higher in stonier surfaces; however, at high rates a larger
      absolute plant number was recorded in finer soils. Two to five years after
      sowing, climatic conditions became more important. Full vegetation cover was
      achieved in all experiments. However, at high altitudes, individual plant cover
      became greater (and plant density decreased), probably because the grasses needed
      to accumulate more non-structural carbohydrates necessary to survive during the
      longer winter. Fertilisation accelerated the establishment of full vegetation
      cover by 1 to 3years as it increased the mean cover per plant without affecting
      plant density. Grassland restoration is possible in mountain raw soils by using
      the seeds collected from nearby donor sites. High sowing densities are not
      required even in coarse or higher altitude soils because, in the short term,
      stones on the ground surface increase the percentage of seed producing
      established plants and, over the long term, plant density is not dependent on the
      sowing density. In low-fertile soils, fertilisation accelerates the establishment
      of full vegetation cover.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) is considered to be a 
      good option for anxious patients, there is a lack of information whether ART
      associated to oral health educational strategy (OHES) would positively influence 
      the level of anxiety and stress in children. This study aimed to evaluate the
      impact of OHES on anxiety and stress markers of schoolchildren submitted to ART. 
      DESIGN: A sample of 78 six- to eight-year-old schoolchildren, with carious
      lesions in dentin, were randomly divided into groups: OHES + ART-group (n = 39)
      and ART-group (n = 39). OHES consisted of an educational interactive strategy
      performed once a week for four weeks. ART was performed using a standardized
      procedure with hand instruments and glass-ionomer cement. Anxiety and stress
      markers were assessed subjectively by the modified Venham Picture Test (m-VPT),
      modified Venham Anxiety Scale (m-VAS), while objective measures consisted of
      heart rate (HR) and salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels evaluated before, 
      during and after treatment. RESULTS: The two groups did not differ in the
      perceived anxiety and in anxious behavior, and the variation along the treatment 
      was not significant in both groups (p > 0.05). Both groups also showed higher HR 
      "Before ART-restoration" than the other time-points as an anticipatory anxiety.
      ART group showed higher HR than OHES + ART group during the "Explanation of
      procedure" (p = 0.041) and "Deep excavation" (p = 0.018), and only ART group
      showed higher amylase levels "Before ART" compared to "After ART" (p = 0.004).
      CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that OHES associated with ART showed a positive
      effect in modulating heart rate and alpha-amylase levels, that is, those markers 
      of stress objectively measured during ART-restoration.

      restoration.
PG  - 34-44

AB  - For tropical forest restoration to result in long-term biodiversity gains, native
      trees must establish self-sustaining populations in degraded sites. While many
      have asked how seedling recruitment varies between restoration treatments, the
      long-term fate of these recruits remains unknown. We address this research gap by
      tracking natural recruits of 27 species during the first 7 years of a tropical
      forest restoration experiment that included both planted and naturally
      regenerating plots. We used an individual-based model to estimate the probability
      that a seedling achieves reproductive maturity after several years of growth and 
      survival. We found an advantage for recruits in naturally regenerating plots,
      with up to 40% increased probability of reproduction in this treatment, relative 
      to planted plots. The demographic advantage of natural regeneration was highest
      for mid-successional species, with relatively minor differences between
      treatments for early-successional species. Our research demonstrates the
      consequences of restoration decision making across the life cycle of tropical
      tree species.

TI  - Liraglutide protects against glucolipotoxicity-induced RIN-m5F beta-cell
      apoptosis through restoration of PDX1 expression.
PG  - 619-629
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13967 [doi]
AB  - Prolonged exposure to high levels of glucose and fatty acid (FFA) can induce
      tissue damage commonly referred to as glucolipotoxicity and is particularly
      harmful to pancreatic beta-cells. Glucolipotoxicity-mediated beta-cell failure is
      a critical causal factor in the late stages of diabetes, which suggests that
      mechanisms that prevent or reverse beta-cell death may play a critical role in
      the treatment of the disease. Transcription factor PDX1 was recently reported to 
      play a key role in maintaining beta-cell function and survival, and
      glucolipotoxicity can activate mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), which, 
      in turn, stimulates PDX1 degradation and causes dysfunction and apoptosis of
      beta-cells. Interestingly, previous research has demonstrated that increased
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signalling effectively protects beta cells from
      glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Unfortunately, few studies have examined the
      related mechanism in detail, especially the role in Mst1 and PDX1 regulation. In 
      the present study, we investigate the toxic effect of high glucose and FFA levels
      on rat pancreatic RINm5F beta-cells and demonstrate that the GLP-1 analogue
      liraglutide restores the expression of PDX1 by inactivating Mst1, thus
      ameliorating beta-cell impairments. In addition, liraglutide also upregulates
      mitophagy, which may help restore mitochondrial function and protect beta-cells
      from oxidative stress damage. Our study suggests that liraglutide may serve as a 
      potential agent for developing new therapies to reduce glucolipotoxicity.

AB  - Soil and water bioengineering is a technology that encourages scientists and
      practitioners to combine their knowledge and skills in the management of
      ecosystems with a common goal to maximize benefits to both man and the natural
      environment. It involves techniques that use plants as living building materials,
      for: (i) natural hazard control (e.g., soil erosion, torrential floods and
      landslides) and (ii) ecological restoration or nature-based re-introduction of
      species on degraded lands, river embankments, and disturbed environments. For a
      bioengineering project to be successful, engineers are required to highlight all 
      the potential benefits and ecosystem services by documenting the technical,
      ecological, economic and social values. The novel approaches used by bioengineers
      raise questions for researchers and necessitate innovation from practitioners to 
      design bioengineering concepts and techniques. Our objective in this paper,
      therefore, is to highlight the practice and research needs in soil and water
      bioengineering for reconciling natural hazard control and ecological restoration.
      Firstly, we review the definition and development of bioengineering technology,
      while stressing issues concerning the design, implementation, and monitoring of
      bioengineering actions. Secondly, we highlight the need to reconcile natural
      hazard control and ecological restoration by posing novel practice and research
      questions.

AB  - The concept of Ecosystem Service (ES) has provided an underpinning framework for 
      ecological restoration research and applications. Ecological restoration is a
      corrective intervention that aims to reverse land degradation and to contribute
      to the 2030 Global Sustainable Development goal of Land Degradation Neutrality.
      It is critical to investigate the long-term effects of ecological restoration and
      land use change on ESs and ES interactions (synergies or trade-offs) to better
      understand the mechanisms supporting this goal. This paper describes an analysis 
      of land use and ESs using historical data for a typical watershed in Chinese
      Loess Plateau, which has experienced series of restoration activities since the
      1950s. Six important ESs (food provisioning, soil retention, hydrological
      regulation, carbon sequestration, water purification and habitat provisioning for
      biodiversity) were quantified at eight intervals between 1958 and 2015. The
      interactions between ESs were evaluated by correlation analysis. The results show
      that soil retention, carbon sequestration, water purification and habitat
      provisioning for biodiversity increased significantly across the different land
      use types over several decades but not hydrological regulation. The relationship 
      between ESs was found to be variable over different time periods and a transition
      point between 1990 and 1995 was identified. Grassland was found to maintain
      greater water yield than woodland with high values of other ESs. The results
      suggest that trade-offs between ESs can be mitigated by adjusting the proportion 
      of some important land use types (such as woodland and grassland).

TI  - Restoration of polar-flagellum motility and biofilm-forming capacity in the mmsB1
      mutant of the alphaproteobacterium Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 points to a new 
      role for a homologue of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase.
PG  - 144-154
LID - 10.1139/cjm-2018-0481 [doi]
AB  - The bacterium Azospirillum brasilense can swim and swarm owing to the rotation of
      a constitutive polar flagellum (Fla) and inducible lateral flagella,
      respectively. They also form biofilms on various interfaces. Experimental data on
      flagellar assembly and social behaviours in these bacteria are scarce. Here, for 
      the first time, the chromosomal coding sequence mmsB1 for a homologue of
      3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (protein accession Nos. ADT80774 and E7CWE2)
      was shown to play a role in the assembly of motile Fla and in biofilm biomass
      accumulation. In the previously obtained mutant SK039 of A. brasilense Sp245, an 
      Omegon-Km insertion in mmsB1 was concurrent with changes in cell-surface
      properties and with suppression of Fla assembly (partial) and Fla-dependent
      motility (complete). Here, the immotile leaky Fla(-) mutant SK039 was
      complemented with the expression vector pRK415-borne mmsB1 gene of Sp245. In the 
      complemented mutant, the elevated relative cell hydrophobicity and changed
      relative membrane fluidity of SK039 returned to the wild-type levels; also,
      biofilm biomass accumulation increased and even reached Sp245's levels under
      nutritionally rich conditions. In strain SK039 (pRK415-mmsB1), the percentage of 
      cells with Fla became significantly higher than that in mutant SK039, and the
      Fla-driven swimming velocity was equal to that in strain Sp245.

TI  - Delayed Effect and Gain Restoration After Intratympanic Gentamicin for Meniere's 
      Disease.
PG  - 79-87
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000001973 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the VOR gain after
      intratympanic gentamicin therapy and to correlate them with the mid-term effects 
      on the control of vertigo, in a population of Meniere's disease patients. STUDY
      DESIGN: The study design was a prospective "Outcomes research." SETTING: Tertiary
      referral center. PATIENTS: This study included 20 patients with unilateral
      Meniere's disease refractory to medical therapy for at least 1 year, and treated 
      with an on demand intratympanic gentamicin protocol. INTERVENTION: Therapeutic.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Audiometry, caloric testing, and a vHIT before beginning
      the protocol were performed. Patients underwent weekly vHIT assessments until a
      significant gain reduction was observed. Subsequently we performed vHIT tests 1
      month after the therapy completion, and then every 3 months for at least 1 year. 
      RESULTS: Complete vertigo control (class A) was achieved in 14 patients at the
      12-month follow-up assessment. We observed a significant reduction in VOR gain
      values at the 3-week follow-up assessment. We found a significant correlation
      between the 1-month posttreatment ipsilateral hVOR gain and the rate of vertigo
      recurrence after the first IT gentamicin treatment (p = 0.012; r = 0.400). At the
      mid-term assessment, 10 patients exhibited a significant partial recovery of the 
      hVOR gain. CONCLUSIONS: The delayed effect of intratympanic gentamicin and the
      subsequent gain restoration are factors that may influence the patients' outcome.
      The feasibility of the vHIT system makes it a useful tool to monitorize the VOR
      changes.

TI  - Restoration Effect and Tribological Behavior of Hyaluronic Acid Reinforced with
      Graphene Oxide in Osteoarthritis.
PG  - 91-97
LID - 10.1166/jnn.2019.16443 [doi]
AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is an unavoidable degenerative disease of the human body. A
      relatively efficient and desirable treatment exists that leads to the ecological 
      restoration of cartilage through the adjustments of the micro-environment of the 
      human body and relies on its self-repairing ability. In the present study,
      lubricants were injected into the knee joints of rats. Hyaluronic acid (HA)
      reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) provided a lubricating condition for
      cartilage repair, as well as played an important role in the regulation of the
      microenvironment in the joint cavity. The experimental results demonstrated that 
      the stability of HA lubricant reinforced with GO was dependent on the presence of
      oxygen-containing functional groups on the graphite oxide nano-sheets. The GO
      could be evenly distributed on the joint surface in the form of a solid
      lubrication film and was able to decrease the articular cartilage necrosis and
      the ratio of MMP-3/TIMP-1 through TIMP-1 activity increase. The HA lubricant
      reinforced with GO demonstrated an apparent antifriction effect on the joint
      surface, providing a stable environment for cartilage repair. It was also
      conducive to long-term lubrication improvement. The adjustment of
      micro-environment between the cartilage friction interfaces might contribute to
      the treatment of osteoarthritis through ecological restoration.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism
      explaining reversion of clinical DAP non-susceptible (NS) MRSA isolates to
      DAP-susceptible (S) by analysis of genomic and cell wall characteristics of
      clinical DAP-NS MRSA and DAP-S MRSA isolates as well as in vitro revertant DAP-S 
      MRSA using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and analysis of biological properties.
      WGS of the 4 clinical DAP-NS MRSA revealed mprF mutations resulting in amino acid
      substitutions or deletion. These same amino acid substitutions and deletion were 
      also observed in the 4 in vitro revertant DAP-S strains. While WGS identified the
      presence of the same mprF mutations in both the DAP-NS and in vitro DAP-S
      revertant strains, new mutations were also detected in other genes and intergenic
      regions of in vitro DAP-S revertant strains. Transmission electron microscopy to 
      assess cell-wall (CW) thickness of 4 sets strains (pre- and post-DAP therapy
      isolates and in vitro DAP-S revertant) showed that 3 of the 4 isolates developed 
      increased thickness of the CW after DAP therapy. After reversion to DAP
      susceptibility, CW thickness was decreased to the same level as DAP-S MRSA. Our
      results indicate that in vitro conversion of DAP-NS MRSA to DAP-S is independent 
      of mprF gene mutations and may be partially explained by a change in CW
      thickness. However, as some strains showed no change in the CW, further studies
      are required to elucidate the different mechanisms of resistance to DAP, and
      factors for conversion of DAP-NS to DAP-S.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of pre-acidification (pH 6.7-5.4) of skim
      milk, followed by pH-restoration of the retentates, on spray-drying performance, 
      physico-chemical properties and functionality of the resulting milk protein
      concentrate (MPC). Powder recovery decreased with decreasing pH of
      pre-acidification but improved with pH-restoration. Colloidal calcium was
      gradually solubilized with decreasing pH of pre-acidification but was slightly
      recovered by pH-restoration. Dissociation of micellar caseins increased with
      decreasing pH of pre-acidification of skim milk and was further increased by
      pH-restoration. Casein micelles maintained their overall structures at
      pre-acidification pH of 6.7-6.0, and partially disintegrated into loosely
      entangled aggregates at pH 5.7-5.4; while after pH-restoration, micelles
      generally maintained their overall structures at pre-acidification pH of 6.0, and
      completely disintegrated at pH 5.7-5.4. Solubility and emulsifying properties of 
      MPC improved with decreasing pH of pre-acidification and with pH-restoration.
      Heat stability of MPC declined with decreasing pH of pre-acidification but
      improved with pH-restoration.

AB  - Vegetation restoration often has a significant effect on the supply of an
      ecosystem service (ES). Assessment of this effect is crucial for informed
      decision-making in sustainable ecosystem management. In this respect, this study 
      analyses three regulating, two provisioning, and a single cultural ES over a
      30-year period (1985 to 2015, with 15years pre-restoration and 15years
      post-restoration) in the Loess Plateau, China, using data from a combination of
      modelling and statistical yearbooks. On applying a suite of standard statistical 
      tools, results indicate: (1) regional scale restoration promotes the increase of 
      vegetation cover as the coverage increased faster between 2000 and 2015 than
      between 1985 and 2000; (2) vegetation restoration changes the temporal trend of
      regulating ESs, and enhances the supply of provisioning and cultural ESs; (3) the
      40 municipalities of the Loess Plateau can be divided into four ES categories
      where areas with poor ES delivery account for about 30% of the Loess Plateau; (4)
      vegetation restoration changes the interaction among ESs, resulting in
      synergistic relationships between provisioning and regulating ESs; (5)
      precipitation has a significant impact on regulating ESs, while population
      density is critical for provisioning and cultural ESs. This study demonstrates
      that ESs, their interactions and their groupings can change across both time and 
      space following the implementation of a vegetation restoration programme, which
      makes understanding ES dynamics complicated. Recommendations are provided for
      improved and coherent ecosystem management.

AB  - Inverse problems appear in many applications, such as image deblurring and
      inpainting. The common approach to address them is to design a specific algorithm
      for each problem. The Plug-and-Play (P&P) framework, which has been recently
      introduced, allows solving general inverse problems by leveraging the impressive 
      capabilities of existing denoising algorithms. While this fresh strategy has
      found many applications, a burdensome parameter tuning is often required in order
      to obtain high-quality results. In this paper, we propose an alternative method
      for solving inverse problems using off-the-shelf denoisers, which requires less
      parameter tuning. First, we transform a typical cost function, composed of
      fidelity and prior terms, into a closely related, novel optimization problem.
      Then, we propose an efficient minimization scheme with a P&P property, i.e., the 
      prior term is handled solely by a denoising operation. Finally, we present an
      automatic tuning mechanism to set the method's parameters. We provide a
      theoretical analysis of the method and empirically demonstrate its
      competitiveness with task-specific techniques and the P&P approach for image
      inpainting and deblurring.

AB  - Vegetation restoration was implemented to control soil erosion in the karst
      regions of southwest China. It is essential to assess the soil function and
      quality scientifically during this process and to adopt suitable management
      practices for this area. However, few studies have been conducted to
      comprehensively evaluate the effect of vegetation restoration on soil quality in 
      this severely eroded karst area. By taking 302 soil samples from 11 vegetation
      types, this study investigated the influence of different types of vegetation
      restoration on soil quality using an integrated soil quality index (SQI) and a
      generalized linear model (GLM). Vegetation types had significant effects on soil 
      properties and thus on soil quality. SQI was developed by using TN, TP, TK, AP,
      and clay content; TN had highest weighting values (0.58), which indicated that it
      contributed the most to final SQI. The highest and lowest SQI values were
      observed for primary forest and cropland, respectively. Overall, vegetation
      restoration (e.g., natural restoration, artificial forests and artificial
      grassland) improved soil quality significantly. A GLM model explained 73.20% of
      the total variation in SQI, and vegetation type explained the largest proportion 
      (46.39%) of the variation, which implies that the vegetation restoration
      practices can greatly enhance the soil quality in karst landscapes of southwest
      China. The results of this study may be used to improve implication of ecological
      restoration and management in degraded regions.

AB  - Molecular targets to reduce muscle weakness and atrophy due to oxidative stress
      have been elusive. Here we show that activation of Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR)
      Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) with CDN1163, a novel small molecule allosteric SERCA
      activator, ameliorates the muscle impairment in the CuZnSOD deficient (Sod1(-/-))
      mouse model of oxidative stress. Sod1(-/-) mice are characterized by reduced
      SERCA activity, muscle weakness and atrophy, increased oxidative stress and
      mitochondrial dysfunction. Seven weeks of CDN1163 treatment completely restored
      SERCA activity and reversed the 23% reduction in gastrocnemius mass and 22%
      reduction in specific force in untreated Sod1(-/-) versus wild type mice. These
      changes were accompanied by restoration of autophagy protein markers to the
      levels found in wild-type mice. CDN1163 also reversed the increase in
      mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative damage in muscle tissue from Sod1(-/-)
      mice. Taken together our findings suggest that the pharmacological restoration of
      SERCA is a promising therapeutic approach to counter oxidative stress-associated 
      muscle impairment.

AB  - The Three Rivers Source Region, in the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has a
      sensitive and fragile ecological environment. Adverse changes in climate and
      human activities have degraded the grassland ecosystems. To mitigate or reverse
      the degradation, alleviate rural poverty, and stimulate economic development,
      ecological restoration projects have been implemented. In the present study, our 
      goal was to assess the ecological and socioeconomic effects of these programs
      based on land-use change, grassland NPP, and household surveys. Household data
      were collected using structured questionnaires in 11 villages from three
      counties, with average elevation above 3773masl. We found that the grassland
      degradation had been mitigated, especially after the implementation of ecological
      restoration programs since 2005 in a regional nature reserve in Qinghai Province.
      Household income depends strongly on the region's natural resources, so the
      grassland ecosystems are still at risk of unsustainable use. A household that
      understood the effects of the ecological restoration programs and had received
      training to participate in the programs was more willing to participate in future
      programs. Our findings suggest that for successful restoration, it is essential
      to help residents of the study area thoroughly understand the ecological
      restoration programs and learn the restoration techniques before implementation
      of such programs. This is because the participation of the residents depended
      strongly on both their income and their satisfaction with the ecological
      restoration programs.

TI  - Depth Restoration From RGB-D Data via Joint Adaptive Regularization and
      Thresholding on Manifolds.
PG  - 1068-1079
LID - 10.1109/TIP.2018.2872175 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel depth restoration algorithm from RGB-D data
      through combining characteristics of local and non-local manifolds, which provide
      low-dimensional parameterizations of the local and non-local geometry of depth
      maps. Specifically, on the one hand, a local manifold model is defined to favor
      local neighboring relationship of pixels in depth, according to which, manifold
      regularization is introduced to promote smoothing along the manifold structure.
      On the other hand, the non-local characteristics of the patch-based manifold can 
      be used to build highly data-adaptive orthogonal bases to extract elongated image
      patterns, accounting for self-similar structures in the manifold. We further
      define a manifold thresholding operator in 3D adaptive orthogonal spectral
      bases-eigenvectors of the discrete Laplacian of local and non-local manifolds-to 
      retain only low graph frequencies for depth maps restoration. Finally, we propose
      a unified alternating direction method of multipliers optimization framework,
      which elegantly casts the adaptive manifold regularization and thresholding
      jointly to regularize the inverse problem of depth maps recovery. Experimental
      results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with
      the state-of-the-art works with respect to both objective and subjective quality 
      evaluations.

TI  - Demographic factors in the choice of coronal restoration after root canal
      treatment in the Swedish adult population.
PG  - 58-64
LID - 10.1111/joor.12723 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After root canal treatment, a choice is made between different
      coronal restorations which in the long run could affect the survival of the
      tooth. OBJECTIVE: To compare demographic characteristics between individuals
      choosing an indirect coronal restoration (crown, inlay/onlay) and individuals
      choosing other restorations after completion of a root filling. METHODS: The
      cohort consisted of all root-filled upper first molars that were reported to the 
      tax-funded Swedish Social Insurance Agency (SSIA) during 2009. After registration
      of the root filling, any subsequent coronal restorations within 2 years were
      identified. The crown group consisted of individuals registered with an indirect 
      coronal restoration and the restoration group was the remaining individuals with 
      a direct coronal restoration or lacking registration. Demographic data (gender,
      disposable income, age, educational level, civil status and country of birth)
      were received from Statistics Sweden or the SSIA. Statistical analyses included
      chi-square test, t test and logistic regression analysis. P < 0.05 was considered
      statistically significant. RESULTS: An indirect coronal restoration was received 
      by 7806 individuals (21.9%), and 27 886 individuals (78.1%) received a direct
      restoration. All demographic variables except gender differed significantly
      between groups. Logistic regression analysis found significant associations for
      all demographic variables and the registration of an indirect restoration except 
      for country of birth and gender. CONCLUSIONS: The identified demographic
      differences between individuals choosing to restore their newly root-filled teeth
      with an indirect restoration compared to those receiving other restorations may
      indicate that the tax-funded Swedish dental insurance fails to provide dental
      care on equal terms for Swedish citizens.

TI  - Cell therapy and left ventricular restoration for ischemic cardiomyopathy:
      long-term results of a perspective, randomized study.
PG  - 64-72
LID - 10.23736/S0026-4725.18.04800-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aim of this study is to verify the potential advantages and benefits 
      of bone-marrow derived autologous stem cells implantation associated to surgical 
      left ventricular restoration (SVR), to report a new modality of cell delivery to 
      myocardium, and to identify possible side effects of this procedure. METHODS:
      Between March 2007 and March 2013, 30 patients affected by ischemic dilative
      cardiomyopathy who received a SVR operation were enrolled in the study. The
      population was divided in two groups:16 patients were randomly assigned to
      receive stem cells therapy in addition to SVR (groupA), 14 patients received a
      placebo (group B). The two groups were homogeneous in respect of age, gender,
      preoperative NYHA class, mitral incompetence and left ventricular sizes and
      volumes. The patients were evaluated by echo and pet-scan before surgery and at 6
      months follow-up, and by echo at subsequent follow-up. RESULTS: Overall 30
      days-in hospital mortality was 0 for the entire cohort. At last follow-up
      ejection fraction increased from 25.3% before surgery to 36.3% in group A, and
      from 31.8% to 45.6% in group B. Reduction of LVEDD was 6% in group A, 9% in group
      B. ESLVV and EDLVD decreased more significantly in patients receiving stem cells 
      (55% vs. 35%). Late cardiac mortality at 9 years follow-up was similar in the two
      groups of patients. No early or late adverse reaction nor cases of infections
      were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients affected by ischemic cardiomyopathy have a
      favourable outcome after SVR. A higher reduction of LVEDV and LVESV assessed by
      CT-Scan evaluation in patients receiving cell therapy, when compared to control
      group, encourages the evolution and refinement of myocardial regenerative therapy
      added to SVR.

TI  - Evaluating the ecosystem services and benefits of wetland restoration by use of
      the rapid benefit indicators approach.
PG  - 148-159
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4101 [doi]
AB  - Wetlands in urban and urbanizing areas are often smaller, more degraded, and
      subject to more stressors than those in undeveloped locations. Their restored
      level of functioning may never equal that of a site in an undisturbed landscape. 
      Yet, the social benefits from restoring these wetlands may be significant because
      of the relative scarcity of wetlands and natural areas in urban settings and also
      the large number of people who may benefit. In this study, we have outlined a
      systematic approach to compiling nonmonetary indicators of wetlands restoration
      benefits: The Rapid Benefit Indicators (RBI) Approach. The RBI approach is
      grounded in economic theory and compatible with methods used by environmental
      economists to value ecosystem services. We illustrate the RBI approach with a
      comparison of 2 sites within the Woonasquatucket River Watershed in Rhode Island.
      As an urbanizing watershed, the Woonasquatucket illustrates how decisions may
      differ when based primarily on evaluations of ecological functioning versus those
      that incorporate benefits to people. It demonstrates how small urban sites with
      relatively low ecological function can provide large social benefits. Integr

      ecosystems? A meta-analysis in China.

AB  - Biodiversity is an important ecosystem characteristic, and is vital for
      maintaining ecosystem health and stability. However, biodiversity was often
      ignored in previous Chinese restoration planning and design due to its complex
      roles and the unclear mechanisms in providing human well-being. In order to
      evaluate the response of biodiversity to ecological restoration in terrestrial
      ecosystems, we assembled biodiversity in different metrics and different
      organisms and generated a large dataset comprised 2099 observations from 103
      published studies to conduct a meta-analysis in China. Our results revealed that 
      the biodiversity of restored ecosystem increased by 43% compared with degraded
      state, but it was difficult to recover to the natural level across the whole
      China. The gap between restored and natural ecosystems was about 13%. Ecological 
      restorations have contributed not only to increasing vegetation coverage but also
      to improving soil environment and habitat quality. The recovery levels of
      vascular plant, soil microorganism and soil invertebrate were 30%, 73% and 48%,
      respectively. Biodiversity recovery would be better reflected in enhancing the
      structure feature (65%) such as plant height and density rather than the
      diversity feature (18%) such as diversity indices of Shannon and Simpson.
      Moreover, the response of biodiversity to ecological restoration varied with
      restoration actions (i.e., initial land use/cover type, restoration approach and 
      restoration age), and the interaction effects among restoration actions
      significantly impacted biodiversity recovery. Passive approach performed better
      than active approach for biodiversity recovery. Meanwhile, the magnitude and
      direction of the impact of ecological restoration on biodiversity greatly altered
      with environmental conditions (i.e., climate condition and altitude). Our
      findings could facilitate priority setting and selection of treatment methods for
      biodiversity recovery during ecological restoration planning and assessment to
      ensure high effectiveness and sustainability.

TI  - Restoration of GATA4 expression impedes breast cancer progression by
      transcriptional repression of ReLA and inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling.
PG  - 917-927
LID - 10.1002/jcb.27455 [doi]
AB  - There are increasing reports of aberrant expression of GATA4, correlated with
      oncogenesis and malignant progression in some solid tumors, but whether GATA4
      functions as an oncogenic driver or a tumor suppressor in carcinogenesis remains 
      controversial. Because the role and mechanism of GATA4 in breast cancer (BrCa)
      remain poorly understood, we focused on the expression of GATA4 in BrCa cell
      lines and tissues and its mechanism in breast oncogenesis. Semiquantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot
      analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect expression of GATA4 in
      BrCa cell lines and adjacent breast tissues. Methylation statuses of the GATA4
      promoter were studied using methylation-specific PCR in BrCa cell lines.The
      effects of GATA4 on proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle were also analyzed.
      Compared with adjacent breast tissue, GATA4 expression in BrCa tissue and cell
      lines was obviously lower and low expression levels of GATA4 predicted poor
      outcome. Methylation of GATA4 occurred in almost all of BrCa cell lines . GATA4
      overexpression decreased viability, invasion, migration, and
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of MB-231 and BT549 cells, and markedly
      induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Exogenous expression GATA4 accompanied a
      significant alteration of MMP2, MMP3, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin expression and
      induction of the caspase-8 pathway. Moreover, GATA4 could directly repress RelA
      (p65) transcription, reduce the nuclear phosphorylation-p65 and upregulate
      inhibitor kappa B expression. Altogether, GATA4 plays a tumor-suppressive role
      via repression of NF-kappaB signaling in BrCa cells. Our findings suggest that
      GATA4 is a potential prognostic biomarker and gene therapeutic target for human
      BrCa.

TI  - Chicken semen cryopreservation and use for the restoration of rare genetic
      resources.
PG  - 447-455
LID - 10.3382/ps/pey360 [doi]
AB  - For the past 50 yr, practices for ex situ preservation of endangered breeds have 
      been extended. Semen and primordial germ cells, gonadic tissues have been frozen 
      to create genetic stocks of chicken genetic diversity in cryobanks. Semen
      cryopreservation stays the preferred method since it is not invasive. Many
      protocols have been developed to cryopreserve chicken semen, but they give highly
      variable success rate. The aim of the present study was to standardize and prove 
      the effectiveness of semen long-term storage for the restitution of lost
      families. We showed that semen straws stored for 18 yr in liquid nitrogen did not
      lose their fertilizing ability. We demonstrated the usefulness of cryopreserved
      semen stored in the French National Cryobank for the recovery of families of a
      subfertile experimental chicken line. In order to highlight the standardization
      of the cryopreserved method, different cryoprotectant protocols were also tested 
      on a rare breed, freezing/thawing and insemination conditions were controlled.
      The best results were obtained using glycerol protocol, a sperm dilution of 1:4
      (semen:extender). The insemination dose of 200 million sperm/female was as
      efficient as 400 million of sperm. Altogether, these results demonstrated the
      effectiveness of chicken semen long-term storage for the restoration of lost
      genetic resources and highlighted the importance of standardized chicken semen
      cryopreservation using procedures combining biophysical (cryoprotectants,
      freezing/thawing conditions) and zootechnical (artificial insemination) features.

TI  - Accelerating GMM-Based Patch Priors for Image Restoration: Three Ingredients for 
      a Speed-Up.
PG  - 687-698
LID - 10.1109/TIP.2018.2866691 [doi]
AB  - Image restoration methods aim to recover the underlying clean image from
      corrupted observations. The expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL) algorithm is a
      powerful image restoration method that uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior 
      on the patches of natural images. Although it is very effective for restoring
      images, its high runtime complexity makes the EPLL ill-suited for most practical 
      applications. In this paper, we propose three approximations to the original EPLL
      algorithm. The resulting algorithm, which we call the fast-EPLL (FEPLL), attains 
      a dramatic speed-up of two orders of magnitude over EPLL while incurring a
      negligible drop in the restored image quality (less than 0.5 dB). We demonstrate 
      the efficacy and versatility of our algorithm on a number of inverse problems,
      such as denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, and devignetting. To
      the best of our knowledge, the FEPLL is the first algorithm that can
      competitively restore a pixel image in under 0.5 s for all the degradations
      mentioned earlier without specialized code optimizations, such as CPU
      parallelization or GPU implementation.

TI  - Exercise training ameliorates bleomycin-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition
      and lung fibrosis through restoration of H2 S synthesis.
PG  - e13177
LID - 10.1111/apha.13177 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Clinical trials have shown the beneficial effects of exercise training
      against pulmonary fibrosis. This study aimed to investigate whether prophylactic 
      intervention with exercise training attenuates lung fibrosis via modulating
      endogenous hydrogen sulphde (H2 S) generation. METHODS: First, ICR mice were
      allocated to Control, Bleomycin, Exercise, and Bleomycin + Exercise groups.
      Treadmill exercise began on day 1 and continued for 4 weeks. A single
      intratracheal dose of bleomycin (3 mg/kg) was administered on day 15. Second, ICR
      mice were allocated to Control, Bleomycin, H2 S, and Bleomycin + H2 S groups. H2 
      S donor NaHS (28 mumol/kg) was intraperitoneally injected once daily for 2 weeks.
      RESULTS: Bleomycin-treated mice exhibited increased levels of collagen
      deposition, hydroxyproline, collagen I, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1,
      Smad2/Smad3/low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP-6)/glycogen
      synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylation, and Smad4/beta-catenin
      expression in lung tissues (P < 0.01), which was alleviated by exercise training 
      (P < 0.01 except for Smad4 and phosphorylated GSK-3beta: P < 0.05).
      Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis was associated with increased alpha smooth muscle
      actin (alpha-SMA) and decreased E-cadherin expression (P < 0.01). Double
      immunofluorescence staining showed the co-localization of E-cadherin/alpha-SMA,
      indicating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) formation, which was
      ameliorated by exercise training. Moreover, exercise training restored
      bleomycin-induced downregulation of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and
      cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) expression, as well as H2 S generation in lung
      tissue (P < 0.01). NaHS treatment attenuated bleomycin-induced TGF-beta1
      production, activation of LRP-6/beta-catenin signalling, EMT and lung fibrosis (P
      < 0.01 except for beta-catenin: P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Exercise training restores
      bleomycin-induced downregulation of pulmonary CBS/CSE expression, thus
      contributing to the increased H2 S generation and suppression of TGF-beta1/Smad
      and LRP-6/beta-catenin signalling pathways, EMT and lung fibrosis.

AB  - Soil microbial metabolism is vital for nutrient cycling and aboveground ecosystem
      stability. A general understanding of microbial metabolism and nutrient
      limitation under human disturbance in arid and semi-arid regions, which are the
      largest and most fragile oligotrophic ecosystems globally, however, is still
      limited. We quantified and compared the characteristics of nutrient limitation of
      soil microbes under natural/artificial grassland and shrubland, an ecological
      forest, an economic forest, and sloped cropland in typical arid and semi-arid
      ecosystems on the Loess Plateau, China. Vegetation restoration significantly
      affected the activities of extracellular enzymes and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry
      mainly by affecting soil nutrients and nutrient stoichiometry. A vector analysis 
      of enzyme activity indicated that microbial communities were co-limited by carbon
      (C) and phosphorus (P) in all types of vegetation restoration. Linear regression 
      indicated that microbial C and P limitations were significantly correlated with
      the stoichiometry of soil nutrient, suggesting that the balance of nutrient
      stoichiometry is an important factor maintaining microbial metabolism and
      elemental homeostasis. C and P limitations in the microbial communities were the 
      lowest in the natural grassland. This implies that both vegetation and microbial 
      communities under the restoration pattern of natural grassland were more stable
      under environmental stress, so the restoration of natural grassland should be
      recommended as the preferred option for ecosystem restoration in these arid and
      semi-arid regions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of
      complete restoration of respiratory muscle function in subjects with spinal cord 
      injury. METHODS: This was an interventional study investigating three subjects
      maintained on a diaphragm pacing system who were implanted with the spinal cord
      stimulation system to restore cough. Peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure 
      generation were the primary physiologic outcome measures; an assessment of the
      degree of difficulty in raising secretions was the primary clinical outcome
      measure. RESULTS: Mean peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation
      during spontaneous efforts were 1.7 +/- 0.2 L/s and 31 +/- 7 cmH2O, respectively.
      When spinal cord stimulation was applied after pacing volume associated with the 
      subject's maximum inspiratory effort and synchronized with the subject's maximum 
      expiratory effort, peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure generation were
      9.0 +/- 1.9 L/s and 90 +/- 6 cmH2O, respectively (P < 0.05). Moreover, each
      subject experienced much greater ease in raising secretions and marked
      improvement in the ease in raising secretions compared with other methods.
      CONCLUSIONS: Complete restoration of respiratory muscle function can be safely
      and effectively achieved in the same individuals with spinal cord injury. Spinal 
      cord stimulation results in peak expiratory airflow and airway pressure
      generation characteristic of a normal cough, whereas diaphragm pacing was
      successful in maintaining patients off mechanical ventilation.

AB  - This article describes a workflow based on a top-down approach to provide a
      fixed-type immediate interim restoration after placing a single implant using a
      digitally driven surgical guide and a matrix-positioning device. A characteristic
      of the technique is that both the surgical guide and the matrix-positioning
      device are fabricated from a single diagnostic virtual trial restoration designed
      on computer-aided design (CAD) software. This workflow may shorten the time
      required for chairside placement of an interim restoration and enhance esthetics 
      when rehabilitating anterior teeth.

TI  - An improved Richardson-Lucy iterative algorithm for C-scan image restoration and

AB  - The accuracy of measuring inclusion size in direct C-scan image of immersion
      ultrasonic testing is restricted by the lateral resolution of the focused
      transducer, even if a high frequency is used, and the blurred edge due to
      scattering of sound waves at inclusions. In this work, an improved image
      restoration method that is based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) iterative algorithm 
      is proposed, which is used to restore the C-scan image and improve the accuracy
      of inclusion size measurement in immersion ultrasonic testing. For the improved
      RL iterative algorithm, the point spread function (PSF) is derived based on the
      multi-Gaussian beam model and Kirchhoff approximation, which considers the
      propagation properties of sound waves at water-steel interface and the spectral
      characteristics of the transducer with high frequency. In order to determine the 
      final iteration number, the relationship between final iteration number and size 
      of the inclusion in the image is established by restoring the simulated C-scan
      image and further calibrated with size correction factor. The size correction
      factor considers the effect of sound attenuation and electro-mechanical
      transformation encountered in practical testing equipment. Experimental results
      show that the inclusion sizes measured in restored C-scan images agree well with 
      the optical micrograph results, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed
      method.

AB  - Northern wetlands with organic soil i.e., mires are significant carbon storages. 
      This key ecosystem service may be threatened by anthropogenic activities and
      climate change, yet we still lack a consensus on how these major changes affects 
      their carbon sink capacities. We studied how forestry drainage and restoration
      combined with experimental warming, impacts greenhouse gas fluxes of wetlands
      with peat. We measured CO2 and CH4 during two and N2O fluxes during one growing
      season using the chamber method. Gas fluxes were primarily controlled by water
      table, leaf area and temperature. Land use had a clear impact of on CO2 exchange.
      Forestry drainage increased respiration rates and decreased field layer net
      ecosystem CO2 uptake (NEE) and leaf area index (LAI), while at restoration sites 
      the flux rates and LAI had recovered to the level of undrained sites. CH4
      emissions were exceptionally low at all sites during our study years due to
      natural drought, but still somewhat lower at drained compared to undrained sites.
      Moderate warming triggered an increase in LAI across all land use types. This was
      accompanied by an increase in cumulative seasonal NEE. Restoration appeared to be
      an effective tool to return the ecosystem functions of these wetlands as we found
      no differences in LAI or any gas flux components (PMAX, Reco, NEE, CH4 or N2O)
      between restored and undrained sites. We did not find any signs that moderate
      warming would compromise the return of the ecosystem functions related to C
      sequestration.

AB  - Landscape change caused by ecological restoration projects has both positive and 
      negative influences on human livelihoods, yet surprisingly little research on the
      cultural consequences of ecological restoration in agricultural landscapes has
      taken place. Cultural consequences can be captured in the ecosystem services
      framework as cultural ecosystem services (CES). However, assessment and valuation
      of these services to support decision-making for this essential ecosystem is
      lacking. To help fill this gap, we assessed the opinions of Chinese rural
      communities about CES and the changes in their perception under the Grain for
      Green program (GFG), a nationwide program to relieve the pressure on ecosystems
      (soil erosion and land degradation) by converting cultivated land or barren land 
      on steep slopes into grassland and forests. We used Guyuan City in China's
      Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region as a case study, using a workshop to identify the
      CES provided by the agricultural landscape, followed by semi-structured household
      interviews to quantify perceptions of these CES. We found that all eight CES
      types identified by the workshop were perceived by the rural communities.
      Reforestation changed their perceptions of CES directly due to land cover change 
      and indirectly due to the resulting economic changes and migration of mostly
      young workers in search of better jobs. Cultivated land was perceived as more
      important than forest for CES provision. In addition, residential areas were
      perceived as providing significant CES because of local traditions that produce
      close and highly social neighborhood bonds in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - l0TV: A Sparse Optimization Method for Impulse Noise Image Restoration.
PG  - 352-364
LID - 10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2783936 [doi]
AB  - Total Variation (TV) is an effective and popular prior model in the field of
      regularization-based image processing. This paper focuses on total variation for 
      removing impulse noise in image restoration. This type of noise frequently arises
      in data acquisition and transmission due to many reasons, e.g., a faulty sensor
      or analog-to-digital converter errors. Removing this noise is an important task
      in image restoration. State-of-the-art methods such as Adaptive Outlier
      Pursuit(AOP) [1] , which is based on TV with l02-norm data fidelity, only give
      sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new sparse optimization
      method, called l0TV-PADMM, which solves the TV-based restoration problem with
      l0-norm data fidelity. To effectively deal with the resulting non-convex
      non-smooth optimization problem, we first reformulate it as an equivalent
      biconvex Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), and then solve
      it using a proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PADMM). Our
      l0TV-PADMM method finds a desirable solution to the original l0-norm optimization
      problem and is proven to be convergent under mild conditions. We apply l0TV-PADMM
      to the problems of image denoising and deblurring in the presence of impulse
      noise. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that l0TV-PADMM outperforms
      state-of-the-art image restoration methods.

TI  - Should the restoration of adjacent implants be splinted or nonsplinted? A
      systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The decision to splint or to restore independently
      generally occurs during the planning stage, when the advantages and disadvantages
      of each clinical situation are considered based on the proposed treatment.
      However, clinical evidence to help clinicians make this decision is lacking.
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess
      the marginal bone loss, implant survival rate, and prosthetic complications of
      splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study
      was designed according to the Cochrane criteria for elaborating a systematic
      review and meta-analysis and adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
      Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Also, this review was registered at
      the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)
      (CRD42017080162). An electronic search in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library,
      and Scopus databases was conducted up to November 2017. A specific clinical
      question was structured according to the population, intervention, comparison,
      outcome (PICO) approach. The addressed focused question was "Should the
      restoration of adjacent implants be splinted or nonsplinted?" The meta-analysis
      was based on the Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance methods to assess the
      marginal bone loss, implant survival, and prosthetic complications of splinted
      and nonsplinted implant restorations. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were selected for
      qualitative and quantitative analyses. A total of 4215 implants were placed in
      2185 patients (splinted, 2768; nonsplinted, 1447); the mean follow-up was 87.8
      months (range=12-264 months). Quantitative analysis found no significant
      differences between splinted and nonsplinted restorations for marginal bone loss.
      The assessed studies reported that 75 implants failed (3.4%), of which 24 were
      splinted (99.1% of survival rate) and 51 were nonsplinted (96.5% of survival
      rate). Quantitative analysis of all studies showed statistically significant
      higher survival rates for splinted restorations than for nonsplinted
      restorations. Ceramic chipping, screw loosening, abutment screw breakage, and
      soft tissue inflammation were reported in the selected studies. The quantitative 
      analysis found no statistically significant difference in the prosthetic
      complications of splinted and nonsplinted restorations. CONCLUSIONS: Within the
      limitations of this systematic review and meta-analysis, it was concluded that
      there was no difference in the marginal bone loss and prosthetic complications of
      splinted and nonsplinted implant restorations; this is especially true for
      restorations in the posterior region. However, splinted restorations were
      associated with decreased implant failure.

      hydromorphological restoration.
PG  - 132-141
LID - 10.1111/cobi.13176 [doi]
AB  - Although experiences with ecological restoration continue to accumulate, the
      effectiveness of restoration for biota remains debated. We complemented a
      traditional taxonomic analysis approach with information on 56 species traits to 
      uncover the responses of 3 aquatic (fish, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes) and 2 
      terrestrial (carabid beetles, floodplain vegetation) biotic groups to 43
      hydromorphological river restoration projects in Germany. All taxonomic groups
      responded positively to restoration, as shown by increased taxonomic richness
      (10-164%) and trait diversity (habitat, dispersal and mobility, size, form, life 
      history, and feeding groups) (15-120%). Responses, however, were stronger for
      terrestrial than aquatic biota, and, contrary to our expectation, taxonomic
      responses were stronger than those of traits. Nevertheless, trait analysis
      provided mechanistic insights into the drivers of community change following
      restoration. Trait analysis for terrestrial biota indicated restoration success
      was likely enhanced by lateral connectivity and reestablishment of dynamic
      processes in the floodplain. The weaker response of aquatic biota suggests
      recovery was hindered by the persistence of stressors in the aquatic environment,
      such as degraded water quality, dispersal constraints, and insufficient
      hydromorphological change. Therefore, river restoration requires combined local- 
      and regional-scale approaches to maximize the response of both aquatic and
      terrestrial organisms. Due to the contrasting responses of aquatic and
      terrestrial biota, the planning and assessment of river restoration outcomes
      should consider effects on both components of riverine landscapes.

TI  - Toward Functional Restoration of the Central Nervous System: A Review of
      Translational Neuroscience Principles.
PG  - 30-40
LID - 10.1093/neuros/nyy128 [doi]
AB  - Injury to the central nervous system (CNS) can leave patients with devastating
      neurological deficits that may permanently impair independence and diminish
      quality of life. Recent insights into how the CNS responds to injury and reacts
      to critically timed interventions are being translated into clinical applications
      that have the capacity to drastically improve outcomes for patients suffering
      from permanent neurological deficits due to spinal cord injury, stroke, or other 
      CNS disorders. The translation of such knowledge into practical and impactful
      treatments involves the strategic collaboration between neurosurgeons,
      clinicians, therapists, scientists, and industry. Therefore, a common
      understanding of key neuroscientific principles is crucial. Conceptually, current
      approaches to CNS revitalization can be divided by scale into macroscopic
      (systems-circuitry) and microscopic (cellular-molecular). Here we review both
      emerging and well-established tenets that are being utilized to enhance CNS
      recovery on both levels, and we explore the role of neurosurgeons in developing
      therapies moving forward. Key principles include plasticity-driven functional
      recovery, cellular signaling mechanisms in axonal sprouting, critical timing for 
      recovery after injury, and mechanisms of action underlying cellular replacement
      strategies. We then discuss integrative approaches aimed at synergizing
      interventions across scales, and we make recommendations for the basis of future 
      clinical trial design. Ultimately, we argue that strategic modulation of
      microscopic cellular behavior within a macroscopic framework of functional
      circuitry re-establishment should provide the foundation for most neural
      restoration strategies, and the early involvement of neurosurgeons in the process
      will be crucial to successful clinical translation.

AB  - In recent years, cochlear implants (CIs) have been provided in growing numbers to
      people with not only bilateral deafness but also to people with unilateral
      hearing loss, at times in order to alleviate tinnitus. This study presents
      audiological data from 15 adult participants (ages 48 +/- 12 years) with single
      sided deafness. Results are presented from 9/15 adults, who received a CI
      (SSD-CI) in the deaf ear and were tested in Acoustic or Acoustic + CI hearing
      modes, and 6/15 adults who are planning to receive a CI, and were tested in the
      unilateral condition only. Testing included (1) audiometric measures of
      threshold, (2) speech understanding for CNC words and AzBIO sentences, (3)
      tinnitus handicap inventory, (4) sound localization with stationary sound
      sources, and (5) perceived auditory motion. Results showed that when listening to
      sentences in quiet, performance was excellent in the Acoustic and Acoustic + CI
      conditions. In noise, performance was similar between Acoustic and Acoustic + CI 
      conditions in 4/6 participants tested, and slightly worse in the Acoustic + CI in
      2/6 participants. In some cases, the CI provided reduced tinnitus handicap
      scores. When testing sound localization ability, the Acoustic + CI condition
      resulted in improved sound localization RMS error of 29.2 degrees (SD: +/-6.7
      degrees ) compared to 56.6 degrees (SD: +/-16.5 degrees ) in the Acoustic-only
      condition. Preliminary results suggest that the perception of motion direction,
      whereby subjects are required to process and compare directional cues across
      multiple locations, is impaired when compared with that of normal hearing
      subjects.

TI  - Direct restoration of endodontically treated maxillary central incisors: post or 
      no post at all?
PG  - 381-389
LID - 10.1007/s00784-018-2446-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this ex-vivo study was to evaluate the impact of cavity
      size and glass-fiber post (GFP) placement on the load capability of
      endodontically treated maxillary incisors directly restored with resin composite.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six extracted human maxillary central incisors were
      endodontically treated and distributed to four groups (n = 24): access cavity
      (A), access cavity and uni-proximal class III cavity (U), access cavity and
      bi-proximal class III cavity (B), and decoronated tooth (D). Specimens were
      restored with resin composite, and 12 specimen of each group received an
      adhesively placed glass-fiber post (P). Prior to linear loading, specimens were
      exposed to thermo-mechanical loading (TCML). Statistical analysis was performed
      using log-rank test after TCML, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test to
      compare load capabilities (Fmax). RESULTS: Significantly more failures occurred
      in group D for specimens without GFP during TCML (p = 0.001). Fmax (mean (SD) in 
      N was (A) 513 (124), (AP) 554 (201), (U) 438 (171), (UP) 537 (232) (B) 483 (219),
      (BP) 536 (281), D 143 (181), and DP 500 (331), and differed significantly among
      groups (p = 0.003). Pair-wise comparison revealed lower Fmax values for group D
      compared to all other groups (p < 0.034) except group DP. CONCLUSIONS:
      Endodontically treated maxillary central incisors with cavity sizes up to
      bi-proximal class III may be successfully directly restored with resin composite.
      Post placement shows no additional effect except for decoronated endodontically
      treated incisors. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Endodontically treated incisors with access
      cavities to class III cavities can be successfully restored with resin composite.
      Post placement for decoronated ETT is recommended.

TI  - The disorder-specific psychological impairment in complex PTSD: A flawed working 
      model for restoration of trust.
PG  - 79-99
LID - 10.1080/15299732.2018.1451804 [doi]
AB  - This article methodically gathers concepts and findings from related disciplines 
      to propose that there is a fundamental, disorder-specific psychological
      impairment, which defines Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as
      etiologically different from simple PTSD. This impairment is a flawed working
      model for restoration of trust when one partner fears betrayal. This working
      model is legacy of childhood relationships with manipulative caretakers who kept 
      the child powerless to test the trustworthiness of their reasons to break
      promises and to fail the child's expectations. Manipulative caretakers invert the
      respective roles and responsibilities for restoration of trust, which constitutes
      perversion of intimacy. This article describes how that fundamental flaw becomes 
      the cause of patients' disorder, by episodically rendering them powerless to
      ascertain a perception of grave betrayal as true or false in later relationships.
      Repeated failure with experiments for certainty about others' love explains the
      characteristic personality traits and beliefs of persons with Complex PTSD, i.e.,
      cynicism about the world's benevolence, self-derogation and sense of a
      foreshortened future. This article closes with reference to a study that
      investigated the efficacy of a crisis intervention designed to remediate this
      fundamental impairment.

TI  - Esthetic Evaluation of Implant-Supported Single Crowns: The Implant Restoration
      Esthetic Index and Patient Perception.
PG  - e51-e58
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12659 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To test the validity and reliability of a newly developed Implant
      Restoration Esthetic Index (IREI) and to compare esthetic outcomes reported by
      patients and professionals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten graduate students and 10
      prosthodontists assessed esthetic outcomes of 27 single-tooth implants with the
      IREI. Six peri-implant soft tissue parameters were measured using visual analog
      scales: mesial papilla presence, distal papilla presence, gingival trigone, soft 
      tissue curvature, alveolar process deficiency, and soft tissue color and texture,
      as well as the six crown parameters: crown contour, crown position, crown labial 
      convexity, crown characterization, crown color and translucency, and abutment
      visibility. The validity was tested based on Pearson's correlation. The internal 
      consistency reliability was analyzed by Cronbach's alpha. Interclass correlation 
      coefficients (ICC) were calculated to express the test-retest reliability and the
      inter-rater reliability. The correlations between patient and professional
      evaluations were analyzed by Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: The IREI
      demonstrated significant correlation (p < 0.05) to the pink esthetic score and
      white esthetic score (PES/WES). The internal consistency reliability showed a
      Cronbach's Alpha of 0.830. The test-retest reliability was excellent in both the 
      graduate student group and the prosthodontist group, with ICCs of 0.961 and
      0.952, respectively (p < 0.05). The inter-rater reliability was acceptable, with 
      ICCs of 0.649 and 0.667, respectively (p < 0.05). Low correlation coefficients
      were found between patient and professional evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: The results
      of this study indicated that the IREI was considered a valid and reliable index
      involving sufficient parameters for professional esthetic evaluation of
      single-tooth implant restorations. The patient-reported esthetic outcomes had
      poor or no significant correlation to professional-reported outcomes.

TI  - In Vitro Assessment of Retention and Resistance Failure Loads of Teeth Restored
      with a Complete Coverage Restoration and Different Core Materials.
PG  - e229-e236
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12668 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate in vitro the retention and the resistance form, as well
      as the failure modes of maxillary premolars restored with cast metal crowns and
      different core materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty human extracted maxillary 
      premolars were selected according to their size and were embedded in PMMA resin
      blocks. After removing a part of their clinical crowns, the teeth were randomly
      divided into 3 groups of 20 teeth and were either left unrestored, or they were
      restored with amalgam or composite resin. All teeth were prepared for a cast
      metal complete coverage restoration. The restorations were cemented on the
      prepared teeth with a resin-modified glass ionomer luting agent (GC Fuji Plus).
      All specimens were subjected to static loading at 1 mm/min by a universal testing
      machine, until failure. Half the specimens of each group were subjected to
      tensile loading along the long axis of the teeth. The other half were subjected
      to compressive loading at a 30 degrees angle. Failure loads and failure modes for
      each tooth were recorded. The statistical analysis included descriptive
      statistics, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's HSD test. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed 
      statistically significant differences among the 3 tested groups (p < 0.05) for
      both tests. The group of teeth with no core material presented the highest
      failure loads for both the tensile and the compressive loading tests, with mean
      loads of 381.02 Nu and 741.21 Nu, respectively. Mean tensile and compressive
      failure loads for the amalgam group were 277.34 Nu and 584.75 Nu, while the
      composite resin group presented the lowest tensile and compressive failure
      values, which were 250.77 Nu and 465.78 Nu, respectively. The compression loading
      test resulted in the same failure mode for all specimens, which included
      unfavorable fracture of the teeth in combination with detachment of the cast
      metal complete coverage restorations. The tensile loading test resulted in
      different failure modes between the groups that used a core material and the
      group with no core material. CONCLUSIONS: Teeth that lost more than half of their
      coronal structure presented better retention and resistance form if no core
      material was used, provided that a minimum of 2-mm axial wall height was present 
      at the missing part. Teeth that have lost more than half of their coronal
      structure and were restored with amalgam core presented better retention and
      resistance form than those restored with composite resin. Catastrophic fractures,
      extending to the root, were associated with compression forces but not with
      tensile forces.

TI  - LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP OF RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM RESTORATION AFTER A TRIPLE
      TEAR.
PG  - 5-9
LID - 10.1097/ICB.0000000000000530 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate longitudinal multimodal imaging findings in a case of
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration presenting with multiple retinal
      pigment epithelium (RPE) tears showing progressive RPE restoration. METHODS:
      Observational clinical case report. RESULTS: A 79-year-old woman diagnosed with
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration developed 3 consecutive RPE tears in
      her right eye during the course of treatment with intravitreal anti-vascular
      endothelial growth factor therapy. The RPE tears initially appeared
      hypoautofluorescent on fundus autofluorescence. Spectral domain optical coherence
      tomography showed contractile folds of the RPE with adjacent subretinal fluid and
      overlying ellipsoid zone disruption. Over an 8-year follow-up period, the RPE
      defects progressively resolved with a return of patchy fundus autofluorescence.
      Eye-tracked spectral domain optical coherence tomography showed gradual
      restoration of the RPE band defects over an enlarging Type 1 neovascular lesion. 
      CONCLUSION: Some RPE tears may show observable remodeling and restoration over
      time. These changes may be followed longitudinally with multimodal imaging,
      including eye-tracked spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus
      autofluorescence.
